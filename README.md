# CS3219 — Software Design and Architecture (AY2627 Sem 1)

## Friend on Campus (FoC)

**Friend on Campus (FoC)** is a peer-to-peer campus errand platform where
students can request items to be collected from stores or facilities on
campus, and other students can fulfil (and deliver) those requests. The
platform runs on a closed credit economy — credits cannot be bought,
withdrawn, or exchanged for money, and only circulate within the platform.

## Repository Structure

This repository follows a **one-service-per-folder** structure: each
microservice (`user-service/`, `supplier-service/`, `order-service/`,
`credit-service/`) lives in its own top-level folder.

```text
.
├── compose.yaml          # full stack: includes each service's compose file
├── user-service/
├── supplier-service/
├── order-service/
├── credit-service/
├── chat-service/         # N2H: errand chat + content filter
├── shared/               # gRPC contracts/clients, RabbitMQ messaging
├── ui/                   # React app + nginx (the only public entry point)
├── k8s/                  # Kubernetes manifests for AWS EKS (see k8s/README.md)
├── .github/workflows/    # CI/CD: one workflow per service
├── ai/                   # AI usage log for repo-level work (CI, k8s)
└── README.md
```

- `shared/` holds code used by more than one service (proto contracts, gRPC
  clients, the messaging library), so it is not tied to a single service folder.
- Any **nice-to-have (N2H)** feature that warrants its own service should
  be added as an **additional folder** at the same level, following the
  same per-service structure.
- Files for agentic coding tools (e.g. agent configs, prompts, skills)
  may be added as needed, but must still **respect the
  one-service-per-folder skeleton** for core implementation.

## Run the whole stack (Docker)

Requires Docker Desktop. One-time setup:

```sh
npm run keys:generate --prefix user-service     # JWT keys (other services mount the public key)
npm run keys:otp --prefix user-service          # key for hashing sign-up OTP codes
cp user-service/.env.example user-service/.env
cp supplier-service/.env.example supplier-service/.env
cp credit-service/.env.example credit-service/.env
cp order-service/.env.example order-service/.env
cp chat-service/.env.example chat-service/.env
```

Then, from the repository root:

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps -a          # *-migrate jobs Exited (0); everything else healthy
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. The root `compose.yaml` includes each service's own
compose file (plus `shared/messaging` for RabbitMQ and `ui/`):

- **One entry point:** the UI (nginx) publishes `8080`. It serves the app and
  proxies `/backend/*` to the services. Databases, gRPC, Redis and RabbitMQ are
  reachable only on the shared `internal` network, by service name.
- **Sign-up emails:** locally, OTP codes are caught by Mailpit instead of being
  sent. Read them at <http://localhost:8025> (the only other published port).
- **Migrations:** user, order and credit each have a one-off `*-migrate` job, and
  the service starts only after it succeeds; applied migrations are skipped on
  later runs. Supplier's database runs its init scripts on first start, and chat
  creates its tables itself on startup.
- **Redis:** user-service keeps pending OTP codes in Redis, and order-service
  caches supplier details in Redis.
- **Data:** each database uses a named volume, so data survives `down`/`up`.
  `docker compose down -v` deletes it.

```sh
docker compose logs -f <service>    # e.g. credit-service
docker compose down                 # stop, keep data
docker compose down -v              # stop and delete data
```

Each service can also run on its own from its folder (`docker compose up`); its
`compose.override.yaml` then publishes its ports and points it at peers on the
host. Stop standalone stacks before starting the full stack, and vice versa.

## Local service ports

REST and gRPC ports are the same inside and outside containers to make service
configuration predictable.

| Service | REST | gRPC | DB host port (standalone only) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| User service | 3001 | 50051 | 5432 |
| Supplier service | 3002 | 50052 | 54332 |
| Order service | 3003 | 50053 | 5434 |
| Credit service | 3004 | 50054 | 5433 |
| Chat service (N2H) | 3005 | — | 5436 |
| UI (nginx) | 8080 | — | — |
| RabbitMQ | — | — | 5672 (AMQP), 15672 (management UI) |
| Mailpit (local OTP emails) | 8025 (web) | — | 1025 (SMTP) |

PostgreSQL containers listen on `5432` internally. In the full stack only the UI's
8080 and Mailpit's 8025/1025 are published; service and database ports are
published only when a service runs standalone. Container-to-container calls use
service names and the internal port; host processes use `localhost` and the
published host port.

## Deployment (Kubernetes on AWS EKS)

The app runs on an EKS cluster in the `foc` namespace. Full setup, secrets and
troubleshooting are in [k8s/README.md](k8s/README.md).

- **Per service:** a Deployment and Service for the app, a Postgres StatefulSet
  with its own disk, a ConfigMap for settings, a Secret created with `kubectl`
  (never committed), Redis where needed, and a `kustomization.yaml`.
- **Only the UI is public**, through an AWS LoadBalancer. Everything else is
  reachable only inside the cluster.
- **Zero-downtime deploys:** migrations run in an init container, readiness and
  liveness probes gate traffic, and `preStop` lets old pods drain.
- **Autoscaling:** order and credit run 2–6 pods at a 70% CPU target. Headless
  Services and round-robin gRPC clients spread calls across every pod. Chat is
  ready to scale (Redis adapter, WebSocket-only clients) but runs one pod until
  its HPA is enabled.
- **CI/CD:** each service has a GitHub Actions workflow. Pull requests are built
  and checked; merges to `main` push the image to GHCR tagged with the commit
  SHA and deploy it with `kubectl apply -k`. GitHub signs in to AWS with OIDC,
  so no AWS keys are stored. Rolling back means deploying an earlier SHA.

## AI Use Summary

### User service

- **Tool and modes:** Claude Code (Anthropic, Claude Opus). Code generation
  from author-specified requirements, boilerplate and scaffolding, code
  review, debugging, documentation and code explanations.
- **Scope:** Express + Prisma + gRPC scaffold; registration, login with RS256
  JWTs and RBAC; refresh-token sessions with rotation and logout; profile
  update; the internal `GetPublicProfile` gRPC endpoint; admin bootstrap CLI,
  grant/revoke endpoints with last-admin protection and audit records;
  cross-service port standardisation; account deletion and archived-account
  restoration; daily archive purging; Order Service deletion-eligibility gRPC;
  setup and API documentation.
- **Human decisions:** The author chose the stack and specified the schemas,
  endpoints, access rules, error behaviour, session design and admin
  bootstrap approach. Some design points (for example SHA-256 token hashing,
  cookie flags and the caller re-check) were raised by AI and accepted by the
  author; these are marked in the log.
- **Review comments:** Two rounds of Codex automated review on GitHub (PR #56,
  PR #64) are quoted in the log, with the fixes made using Claude.
- **Prompts and key responses:** [user-service/ai/usage-log.md](user-service/ai/usage-log.md).
  AI-influenced files carry header comments; JSON files and migrations are
  listed in the [service README](user-service/README.md#ai-attribution-for-files-without-comments).
- **Sources:** Course material on bootstrapping the first admin
  (https://sds-edu.github.io/resource-bootstrap-first-admin/); official
  Docker images.
- **Verification:** The author reviewed all AI-assisted code and tested the
  endpoints manually.


### Order service

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex), 2026-10-21–2026-10-22. Modes: implementation, configuration and documentation generation.
Used to install Express 5.2.1 and Prisma 6.19.3, transcribe and migrate the author-provided Order schema,
and configure a local Order PostgreSQL container after the author selected
PostgreSQL and Docker, following the existing User Service setup. Also generated the team-approved Express/gRPC startup, database-backed health,
environment validation and application Docker setup.
Also implemented author-specified creation, credit-edit recovery, cancellation
and expiry, with tests and a durable OrderEditOperation migration. Added the
author-approved administrator-only GET /orders listing with authorization tests.
Verified cancellation/expiry failure recovery and applied the team's plaintext
Order-to-Credit transport decision on order-functionality. Implemented the
author-requested authenticated courier acceptance endpoint and concurrency tests.
Added author-specified open/requested/assigned retrieval scopes and access/filter tests.
Implemented the author-approved delivery endpoint and durable Credit settlement
recovery, with real gRPC transport and PostgreSQL integration tests. Verified
the existing editing workflow with additional funding, concurrency and crash
recovery tests against real gRPC transport and Order PostgreSQL. The author
supplied the schema, contracts, retry schedule and final first-lock-wins rule.
Human decisions and superseded requirements are recorded in the service usage log;
no decision rationales were drafted.

Team review and validation remain pending. Prompts, key responses and verification
results are recorded in [order-service/usage-log.md](order-service/usage-log.md). Add a link to this README
to the submission slide deck. This entry covers this session only; the team must
record other AI use and include applicable AGENTS.md/SKILLS.md files before submission.

Order-only integration port, ChatGPT (Codex), 2026-10-24: transferred shared-client
usage, missing-account recovery, Supplier compatibility and courier pickup from
d3-demo into Order. Teammate implementations/root workspace metadata were not
merged. Dependencies and validation limits: Order INTEGRATION_NOTES.md and usage
log. Normal build awaits shared contract PRs.

Main merge / PR preparation, ChatGPT (Codex), 2026-10-25: merged main at 2c8a068,
resolved root package-lock.json from main plus seven Order manifest entries,
and included main's .npmrc in the Order Docker context. Root JSON attribution
uses this summary and Order usage log. PR_DESCRIPTION.md documents implemented
APIs, reproducible reviewer tests and missing teammate contract prerequisites.
Ordinary build is blocked until those contracts merge.

Shared prerequisites completed, ChatGPT (Codex), 2026-10-25: agreed Credit shared
contracts/client/types and Supplier validators are now tracked, with explicit
Zod dependency and approved JSON attribution in shared README/Order usage log.
Normal repository build and 128 shared/Order tests pass without overrides; Order
Docker builds normally. Full Credit business runtime remains the teammate PR;
this branch only keeps its scaffold type-compatible. Earlier build-blocker
notes are superseded by this update.

PR documentation refresh, ChatGPT (Codex), 2026-10-25: documented the existing
shared Supplier validators' runtime Zod import and corrected the dependency
summary in Order PR_DESCRIPTION.md. Prompt/checks: Order usage log. Human review
pending; documentation-only update.


### Credit service
- **Tool and modes:** OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), implementation after human design
  finalization, bounded requirements interpretation/formatting, boilerplate,
  debugging, tests, refactoring, documentation and explanations.
- **Scope:** Credit's PostgreSQL schema and migrations; domain/repository/
  service implementation; atomic initialization, reservation, update, release and
  settlement; gRPC contracts/client retries and service-token authentication;
  authenticated own-balance/history REST with entry-ID bookmarks; RabbitMQ consumer
  integration; Docker/workspace setup; health reporting; tests, attribution records, user lifecycle integration. The [service README](credit-service/README.md)
  documents current interfaces, behavior and setup.
- **Human decisions:** Requirements, architecture, schema, interfaces, policies,
  locking, pagination and security changes came from the human authors. No
  requirements prioritization, backlog/sprint planning, design decisions or
  decision rationales were generated.
- **Prompts and key responses:** Exact exchanges, affected files, recorded reviews
  and actual checks are in [credit-service/ai/usage-log.md](credit-service/ai/usage-log.md),
  entries 001–050. Attribution comments identify AI-influenced files. The approved
  [JSON attribution table](credit-service/README.md#attribution-for-json-files)
  covers formats that cannot contain comments.
- **Verification:** The latest implementation run passed the Credit build and
  Credit checks, and all changes are verified by the author.


### UI order integration and confirmation layout

- **Tool and modes:** ChatGPT (Codex, GPT-6), implementation, debugging,
  regression tests, and documentation on 2026-11-12.
- **Scope:** UI editing through the existing Order PATCH endpoint, credit-history
  order descriptions, HTTP-compatible retry keys, and wrapping confirmation text.
  Backend source, service interfaces, and dependency manifests were unchanged.
- **Prompts and key responses:** [Exact prompts and usage record](ui/ai-usage/ui-order-fix.md).
- **Review:** Automated checks are recorded in the usage log. Human author review
  and live backend verification remain pending.

Open Requests follow-up, 2026-11-12: traced the existing Order visibility query,
added UI refresh and clarified that the list contains other students' unassigned,
unexpired requests. Regression coverage checks the authenticated endpoint, empty
results and failures. Exact prompt and verification are in the same UI usage record.
Human review and live backend verification remain pending.

Signup validation follow-up, 2026-11-12: UI collects all missing password
requirements and displays separate error lines on submit. Existing User service
rules are preserved. Exact prompt, affected files and checks are in
[the UI usage record](ui/ai-usage/ui-order-fix.md).

Minimum-credit wording follow-up, 2026-11-12: creation UI displays the requested
minimum-one-credit message and blocks zero-credit submissions. Exact prompt and
checks are recorded in the UI usage record.

Credit-picker follow-up, 2026-11-12: zero balance initializes to zero with both
adjustment buttons disabled. Existing offers clamp when balance changes.
Boundary tests and exact prompt are in the UI usage record.

### UI bug fixes and chat-service (Maliha)

- **Tool and modes:** Claude (Anthropic, claude.ai), Claude Opus 5.5. Code
  review, debugging, implementation, regression tests and documentation on
  2026-11-12.
- **Scope:** Review of PR #118; UI fixes from the author's bug list (pickup
  place names, order progress, full order details, profile role, password
  warnings, "Deliver by" wording, show/hide password); chat closing 1 h after
  the errand ends with a notice to both people; combining the N2H branch
  with main in one PR.
- **Prompts and key responses:** [ui/ai-usage/usage-log.md](ui/ai-usage/usage-log.md),
  with exact prompts in [ui/ai-usage/prompts/](ui/ai-usage/prompts/).
- **Review:** Automated checks are recorded in the log. Author review and live
  backend testing pending.

Chat fixes, ChatGPT (Codex, GPT-6), 2026-11-12: stable merging and chronological
message display across history/live/ack responses, stale-response cleanup, and
courier completion-screen return-to-chat navigation using existing one-hour
backend access. Exact prompt, files and checks:
[UI chat usage record](ui/ai-usage/chat-bug-fixes.md).
