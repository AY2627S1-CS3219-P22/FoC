# Chat Service — Friend on Campus (FoC)

N2H feature: chat between the requester and courier of an errand (F10), with
content filtering (F10.5). Owner: Maliha.

> AI-assisted (Claude), reviewed and tested by Maliha.

## Stack

- Express 5 + Socket.IO 4, Node 22, TypeScript
- PostgreSQL 16 through `pg`. Tables are created on startup from `schema.sql`
  (`IF NOT EXISTS`), so there is no separate migrate job
- Verifies user-service's RS256 access tokens with its public key
- Content filter: [`obscenity`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/obscenity) for
  swearing, plus a short pattern list for threats

## How it fits with the other services

```text
browser ──/backend/chat──▶ ui (nginx) ──▶ chat-service ──▶ chat-db
                                              │
                                              └─ GET /orders?scope=requested|assigned ─▶ order-service
                                                 (with the user's own token)
```

order-service has no `GET /orders/:id`, and gRPC `GetOrder` is still a stub, so
chat-service asks for the user's own requested/assigned orders with the user's
token and looks for the errand there. That means order-service decides who is on
an order; chat-service never trusts an id the browser sends.

## How it maps to the requirements

| Req | How |
| --- | --- |
| F10.1 | One chat per errand. It opens once a courier accepts |
| F10.1.3 | Messages are pushed over Socket.IO. The sender gets an ack (sent), and a `chat:read` event when the other person has seen it (read) |
| F10.2 | Every join and send re-checks with order-service that the caller is the requester or courier. Nobody else can read or post, admins included |
| F10.3 | History comes back oldest first, each message with its `senderId` |
| F10.4.1 | A job every 5 min deletes chats (and their messages) 1 h after the errand was delivered or cancelled |
| F10.4.2 | The chat stays fully open for 1 h after the errand ends, then closes (reading and sending are both refused). The join reply includes `closesAt` so the UI can tell both people when it closes |
| F10.5 | Swearing is masked (`****`) and still sent. Threats and "kys"-type messages are blocked. Both create a flag (user, order, original text) for admins. Flags are kept after the chat is deleted |

## Run

Needs user-service's keys (`npm run keys:generate --prefix user-service`).

**Full stack:** it is in the root `compose.yaml`. `cp chat-service/.env.example chat-service/.env`,
then `docker compose up --build -d` from the repo root.

**Standalone (Docker):** from this folder, with order-service on port 3003:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
curl http://localhost:3005/health
```

**Dev (hot reload):**

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d chat-db
npm run dev
```

**Tests:** `npm test` (content filter and chat open/close rules).

## Ports

| | Host (standalone only) | Container |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| REST + Socket.IO | 3005 | 3005 |
| PostgreSQL | 5436 | 5432 |

Everything is under `/chat`, so the UI forwards `/backend/chat` → `chat-service:3005/chat`.

## API

### Socket.IO

```ts
io({ path: '/backend/chat/socket.io', auth: { token } })   // through the UI
```

A missing or bad token fails with connect error `unauthorized`.

| Event (client → server) | Payload | Ack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chat:join` | `{ orderId }` | `{ messages, canSend, me, other }` or `{ error }` |
| `chat:send` | `{ orderId, text }` (1–1000 chars) | `{ message, masked }` or `{ error }` |
| `chat:read` | `{ orderId }` | `{}` |
| `chat:leave` | `{ orderId }` | — |

| Event (server → room) | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| `chat:message` | `{ id, orderId, senderId, body, sentAt, readAt }` |
| `chat:read` | `{ orderId, readerId }` |

Error codes: `invalid-input`, `forbidden` (not your errand), `not-started` (no
courier yet), `closed` (errand ended), `blocked` (message filtered), `unavailable`
(order-service or the database is down).

### REST (admin only)

| Method | Path | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/chat/flags` | Unreviewed flags, newest first. `?include=reviewed` for all |
| POST | `/chat/flags/:id/review` | Mark reviewed. 204, or 404 if already reviewed |
| GET | `/health` | Pings the database |

## Known gaps

- **Cleanup needs the chat to be used after the errand ends.** chat-service only
  learns that an errand ended when someone opens or sends in it. If order-service
  starts publishing `order.*` events on RabbitMQ, chat-service should listen for
  delivered/cancelled instead.
- **F10.5 says to flag the user's account.** The flag lives here (user + message).
  A real account flag would need a field in user-service.
