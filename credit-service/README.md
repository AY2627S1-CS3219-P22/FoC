# Credit service

Credit Service manages credit accounts, reservations and history using PostgreSQL
17 and `pg` with explicit SQL migrations. User registration events grant 10 credits
once per user ID. Order Service uses authenticated plaintext gRPC; the frontend
uses JWT-authenticated REST for each user's own balance and history.

| Interface | Address / path | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gRPC | Port 50054, six RPCs listed below | Order Service token |
| REST balance | GET `/credits/me/balance` on port 3004 | User JWT |
| REST history | GET `/credits/me/history` on port 3004 | User JWT |
| Health | GET `/health` on port 3004 | Public |
| User events | RabbitMQ queue `credit.user-events` | `user.created` consumer |

The current implementation has entry-ID page tokens, direct service-token
comparison, and no account/reservation timestamp columns. Archival, restoration
and deletion are deferred. The human's definitions and AI records are retained in
[the usage log](ai/usage-log.md).

The workspace is `credit-service/`, named `@foc/credit-grpc`. TypeScript builds
into `dist/`; `src/index.ts` starts REST, gRPC and the event consumer. The migration
runner is `migrations/apply-migration.cjs`. Local `scripts/` and `docs/` are not
required by a fresh clone.

## Business operations

- `initCredits({ userId })` is an internal method used by the `user.created`
  callback. New accounts receive 10 total/0 reserved credits exactly once per
  userId, with an `INITIAL_GRANT` history row and saved result in one transaction.
  Matching saved successes replay; confirmed prior grants without saved results
  succeed without writes. An existing account lacking grant evidence fails with
  `ALREADY_EXISTS` and no changes.
- `getBalance` returns userId, total, reserved, and computed available credits. A missing
  account fails; reads never initialize an account.
- `reserveCredits` creates a lifetime-unique reservation per order, holds credits,
  records `RESERVED`, and starts version at 1. Insufficient credits fail without
  changes. Without a saved result, an existing matching requester/amount returns
  the current reservation in any status without writes. A mismatch fails with
  `REQUEST_CONFLICT`.
- `updateReservation` takes the new total held and expected version. It checks
  saved result, existence, active status, matching version, changed amount, then
  available credits for an increase. It applies only the difference, increments
  version, and records signed `RESERVATION_UPDATED` deltas. Unchanged amounts are rejected.
- `releaseCredits` decreases reserved credits only, marks `RELEASED`, increments
  version, and records `RELEASED`. Settled reservations fail. An already released
  reservation without a saved result returns its current state without writes.
- `settleCredits` atomically decreases the requester's total and reserved credits,
  increases the courier's total, sets `SETTLED`/courier/version, and writes
  `TRANSFER_OUT` and `TRANSFER_IN`. Missing courier accounts and self-settlement
  fail without changes. Courier assignment is validated by Order Service. Without
  a saved retry result, an already SETTLED reservation returns its current state
  without writes when the courier matches; a different courier fails with
  FAILED_PRECONDITION/REQUEST_CONFLICT. RELEASED reservations fail with INVALID_STATE.
- `getReservation` reads the full current reservation, including its IDs, amount,
  status, courier and version. Missing reservations fail with `NOT_FOUND`.

Mutations own one READ COMMITTED transaction. Lock order is retry key, order
resource (account resource for initialization), then account rows in ascending
user-ID order. Accounts remain locked through history insertion and commit.
The repository never commits or rolls back. Any failure rolls back account,
reservation, history, and retry-result changes together.

Saved successful retries replay before current-state checks. Mutation replies
are snapshots of the state immediately after that operation. An identical reserve
retry after an update can therefore return the original amount/version/status;
call GetReservation to obtain the full current reservation. Existing
missing-result fallback rules above remain unchanged. The operation-scoped
key is userId for initialization, orderId for reserve/release/settle, and
JSON `[orderId, expectedVersion]` for updates. SHA-256 request hashes use the
human's validated-field arrays; caller identity and metadata are excluded.
See [the exact definitions](ai/prompts/014-business-rules-and-implementation-design.md).
The [advisory-lock encoder](src/repos/advisoryLockKey.ts) hashes UTF-8
JSON `[namespace, key]` and converts its first eight bytes to a signed big-endian
64-bit decimal string, following [exchange 019](ai/prompts/019-advisory-lock-key-encoding.md).
PostgreSQL [transaction-level advisory locks](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADVISORY-LOCKS)
release at transaction end.

## Initial-allocation implementation

Credit accepts this `user.created` payload from User Service's event transport:

```json
{
  "type": "user.created",
  "eventId": "registration-event-id",
  "occurredAt": "2026-10-22T00:00:00.000Z",
  "userId": "registered-user-id"
}
```

The [user.created callback and registration helper](src/events/userCreated.ts)
validate deliveries with the shared `userEventSchema`, verify matching delivery
and payload event IDs, and allocate through `initCredits({ userId })`. Allocation
uniqueness remains per userId. Malformed events, unsupported lifecycle types and
inconsistent prior allocations become NonRetryableError; other failures propagate to the shared client's
retry/dead-letter handling. A successful handler finishes only after the allocation
transaction commits or an existing grant is confirmed. Duplicate event IDs or
different events for the same user cannot grant credits again.

The [consumer startup helper](src/events/broker.ts) connects a RabbitMQClient for
CREDIT_USER_QUEUE using serviceName credit-service and prefetch 10. It closes its
client if connection/consumer setup throws. Configure RABBITMQ_URL: host execution
defaults to `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672`; the Docker example reaches a broker
published on the Docker host. Supply a URL reachable from your chosen deployment.
After both API listeners start, `index.ts` attempts consumer startup in the
background with the same CreditService instance. A failed connection,
registration or package load is logged; the REST and gRPC APIs keep running.
This is one startup attempt: after a failure, restart Credit once the package
and broker are available. No consumer reconnect loop is added here. SIGINT/SIGTERM
close both API listeners, wait for any pending consumer startup, close the broker
if connected, then end the database pool. A broker close failure is logged and
does not skip database cleanup.

`@foc/messaging` is now included as a local workspace and Credit dependency;
root builds, Credit predev and the Docker image build it before Credit. The
package was copied from `origin/events/data-validation` at
`0b48f5f85be01d148176a6410c9ca22c2b8e672e`. **Broker implementation and contracts
are authored by @sunpterodactyl and the shared messaging contributors.** This PR
includes their code for integration/testing and does not claim its authorship.
The [package README](../shared/messaging/README.md) records the import and original
AI declarations. Credit-specific work is consumer wiring and tests.
User Service publication remains owned by its implementer. There is no InitCredits RPC.

## gRPC authentication and errors

The shared [credit.proto](../shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto) exposes:

| RPC | Request fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GetBalance | userId | userId, totalCredits, reservedCredits, availableCredits |
| ReserveCredits | orderId, requesterId, amount | Full reservation |
| UpdateReservation | orderId, amount, expectedVersion | Full reservation |
| ReleaseCredits | orderId | Full reservation |
| SettleCredits | orderId, courierId | Full reservation |
| GetReservation | orderId | Full current reservation |

A full reservation contains orderId, requesterId, amount, status, optional courierId,
reservationId and version. Shared TypeScript clients use camelCase; protobuf field
names use snake_case. Initialization is event-driven and history is REST-only.

The six order-only RPCs are GetBalance, ReserveCredits, UpdateReservation,
ReleaseCredits, SettleCredits, and GetReservation. The caller supplies
`x-credit-service-token` metadata. Credit derives service identity from its
configured secret using direct string equality. Missing/unknown or
multiple tokens yield `UNAUTHENTICATED`; a known unauthorized service yields
`PERMISSION_DENIED`. Only the order-service secret is configured at startup.

Set `CREDIT_ORDER_SERVICE_TOKEN` to the same secret on Credit and Order Service.
Credit gRPC always uses plaintext on port 50054 (or the configured GRPC_PORT).
Order uses the shared client's default plaintext credentials and sends
x-credit-service-token. There are no Credit TLS configuration variables.
CREDIT_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH is still required for REST user-token verification.

Business errors preserve gRPC codes and the `x-credit-error-reason` trailer:
ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND, RESERVATION_NOT_FOUND, INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS, VERSION_CONFLICT,
INVALID_STATE, or REQUEST_CONFLICT. Invalid IDs/amounts fail before connecting to
the database. Order IDs must be lowercase hyphenated UUIDs. Amounts and expected
versions are positive int32 integers. IDs must be nonempty, at most 128 characters,
with no leading/trailing whitespace or control characters.
Database serialization/deadlock/lock failures map to
ABORTED; connection failures map to UNAVAILABLE; unknown failures map to INTERNAL.
Only the dedicated ValidationError maps to INVALID_ARGUMENT (or REST 400).
Unexpected errors, including ordinary TypeError, return generic INTERNAL/500
messages and are logged with the original error on the server. Known business,
authentication and transient error mappings are preserved.

The shared Credit client preserves codes/trailers and retries only UNAVAILABLE,
ABORTED and DEADLINE_EXCEEDED using an application loop.
The defaults are three total attempts within one 1,300 ms budget; the backoff base
starts at 50 ms, doubles, caps at 500 ms, and each wait is half the base plus a
random amount up to half the base. Every attempt uses the remaining budget.
Earlier upstream deadlines apply; delays that consume the remaining time are
skipped, and no retry starts after expiration. The last error is returned unchanged.
Client/per-call overrides are documented in the
[shared client reference](../shared/grpc/README.md#credit-client-retries), including
the existing timeoutMs override and maxAttempts/initialDelayMs/backoffMultiplier/
maxDelayMs. Other service client behavior is unchanged.

## Health

Public GET `/health` on port 3004 runs `SELECT 1` and reports event-listener startup:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "db": "up", "listener": "up" }
```

| Database | Listener startup | HTTP | Overall status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| up | up or down | 200 | ok |
| down | up or down | 503 | degraded |

The listener flag is down while starting, after startup failure or during explicit
shutdown, and up after startup succeeds. It reports startup success only; it does
not detect later broker disconnects or consumer cancellation. API listeners remain
available if consumer startup fails. No token is required.

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3004/health
```

Compose has a PostgreSQL healthcheck; it does not configure one for Credit itself.

## Frontend REST and user history

GET `/credits/me/balance` returns userId, totalCredits, reservedCredits, and
availableCredits. GET `/credits/me/history` accepts optional pageSize and
pageToken and returns entries and nextPageToken (null on the last page).
Responses use camelCase, string IDs, ISO UTC timestamps, integer credits, and
null optional links. History entries and pagination tokens omit the internal
sequenceId. Each nextPageToken is the base64url-encoded UUID of the last entry
returned on that page.

Both routes require `Authorization: Bearer <user token>`. Credit verifies the
User Service RSA public key, RS256 only, a subject and an unexpired exp. The
subject selects the user; caller-supplied IDs or admin roles give no extra reach.
Errors have `{ error, message }` fields. Matching GET routes require authentication;
missing/invalid tokens return 401. Route matching happens first, so an unknown
path returns 404 even without a token. Known limitation: unsupported methods
currently return 404 rather than 405, with or without a token.
On matched routes, invalid sizes/bookmarks return 400; missing accounts return 404; transient
service failures return 503; internal failures return 500. Unknown users have
empty history, entries [] and nextPageToken null.

The REST listener runs on port 3004. Set CREDIT_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH to the User
Service public PEM. Local Compose mounts CREDIT_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE read-only
at /run/credit/user-service-public.pem, defaulting to ../user-service/keys/public.pem
relative to the Compose file. Supply that public file before starting; no private
User Service key is read, mounted, or packaged.

Both history RPCs, their messages/types, and client wrappers have been removed.
User history is REST-only; there is no order-history operation.

History storage/query support is implemented. Entries retain order_id and
reservation_id (nullable for initial grants), both signed deltas, and created_at.
Migration 006 adds an always-generated bigint sequence_id, unique sequence index,
`(user_id, sequence_id DESC)` index, and one INITIAL_GRANT per user via a partial
unique index. There is no order-history method/index. Queries page downward below
the sequence boundary; sequence values stay decimal strings in JavaScript.
Created_at is display-only: PostgreSQL [now()](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-CURRENT)
uses transaction start. The human selected default page size 50, maximum 100,
entry-ID bookmarks, and INVALID_ARGUMENT for invalid sizes/tokens.
Bookmarks encode the last returned entry's UUID as UTF-8 base64url, without JSON,
user ID or sequence ID. On continuation, Credit validates the token and looks up
the private sequence boundary using `WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2`, with user_id
from the authenticated subject. Malformed UUIDs, nonexistent entries and entries
belonging to another user all produce `Invalid history page token` (REST 400).
Old `{ userId, sequenceId }` tokens are rejected. No schema or migration change
is needed. Query pageSize defaults to 50 and must be an integer from 1 to 100.
Pages fetch one extra row; later requests use sequence_id strictly below the
resolved boundary. Sequence values and the existing ordering/index stay internal.

## Setup and configuration

Run commands from the repository root. Supply User Service's public PEM before
starting Credit. Host execution reads `CREDIT_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH`; Compose mounts
`CREDIT_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE` read-only. No private User Service key is needed.

| Configuration | Host default / requirement |
| --- | --- |
| CREDIT_ORDER_SERVICE_TOKEN | Required; match Order Service's configured secret |
| CREDIT_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH | `../user-service/keys/public.pem`, relative to Credit's working directory |
| RABBITMQ_URL | `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672` |
| HTTP_HOST / HTTP_PORT | `0.0.0.0` / `3004` |
| GRPC_HOST / GRPC_PORT | `0.0.0.0` / `50054` |
| PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD, PGDATABASE | Set for the chosen PostgreSQL database |

For host development, populate the ignored `credit-service/.env` from
[.env.example](.env.example), then run:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev --workspace @foc/credit-grpc
```

The predev script builds both shared packages. For Docker, provide a reachable
RabbitMQ broker separately; this Compose file starts PostgreSQL and Credit only:

```sh
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml up -d --build
```

The example uses local development credentials. For personal configuration, pass
your selected ignored env file consistently. The Docker example connects to
RabbitMQ through `host.docker.internal`. PostgreSQL uses database/user
`credit_service`, host port 5433 (override CREDIT_POSTGRES_PORT), and internal
address `postgres:5432`. Data persists in the named credit_service_pgdata volume.
Compose waits for PostgreSQL's healthcheck. Migrations are applied explicitly below.

After source changes, rebuild the running container using the same selected
configuration; a previous image does not pick up source edits automatically:

```sh
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml up -d --build --no-deps credit-service
```

To open psql or stop the stack while retaining the database volume:

```sh
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml exec postgres psql -U credit_service -d credit_service
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml down
```

## SQL migrations

The current tables are credit_accounts, reservations, credit_history and
idempotency_records.

Apply each SQL file once, in order, using the transactional CLI at
`migrations/apply-migration.cjs` (invoked by `npm run db:migrate`). It has no migration
ledger or automatic skipping. Apply only missing files on an existing database;
the commands below list the full sequence for a fresh database. Migration 009
requires the updated service queries that omit account/reservation timestamps.
The last recorded local application completed migrations 001–009; that does not
establish which migrations a teammate's database has applied.

```sh
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml exec -T credit-service npm run db:migrate -- migrations/001_initial.sql
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml exec -T credit-service npm run db:migrate -- migrations/002_align_credit_contract.sql
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml exec -T credit-service npm run db:migrate -- migrations/003_uppercase_reservation_status.sql
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml exec -T credit-service npm run db:migrate -- migrations/004_reservation_invariants.sql
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml exec -T credit-service npm run db:migrate -- migrations/005_initial_grant_history_type.sql
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml exec -T credit-service npm run db:migrate -- migrations/006_history_types_and_paging.sql
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml exec -T credit-service npm run db:migrate -- migrations/007_credit_delta_constraints.sql
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml exec -T credit-service npm run db:migrate -- migrations/008_history_links_and_uniqueness.sql
docker compose --env-file credit-service/.env.docker.example -f credit-service/compose.yaml exec -T credit-service npm run db:migrate -- migrations/009_remove_account_reservation_timestamps.sql
```

The CLI uses PGHOST/PGPORT/PGUSER/PGPASSWORD/PGDATABASE; PGDATABASE must be explicit.
It uses one connection and transaction, following [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/features/transactions).
Migration 004 enforces unique order_id, settled iff courier is set, and distinct
participants. Migration 005 changes the initial label. Migration 006 converts all
remaining legacy labels, adds sequence paging and initial-grant uniqueness, and
replaces the type check with the six human-specified values. Invalid legacy data
causes a full rollback; it is not removed or silently repaired. Idempotency
operation_type values retain init_credits/reserve/update/release/transfer.
Migration 007 enforces credit_amount > 0 and version > 0 in PostgreSQL. History
deltas are checked by type: INITIAL_GRANT exactly (10, 0); RESERVED
(0, positive); RESERVATION_UPDATED (0, nonzero); RELEASED (0, negative);
TRANSFER_OUT (negative, equal negative); TRANSFER_IN (positive, 0).
Each pair is (total_amount_change, total_reserved_change). Existing invalid rows
reject the entire migration without rewriting data.
Migration 008 requires order_id and reservation_id for every non-INITIAL_GRANT
history entry and forbids both links on INITIAL_GRANT. Its partial unique index
on (reservation_id, type) covers RESERVED, RELEASED, TRANSFER_OUT and TRANSFER_IN;
RESERVATION_UPDATED may occur multiple times. Invalid legacy links or duplicate
indexed events reject the entire migration; no data is repaired or deleted.
Migration 009 drops created_at and updated_at from credit_accounts and reservations.
The account model and repository no longer read or write those columns.
credit_history.created_at and idempotency_records.created_at remain. The existing
balance/reservation REST and gRPC response fields are unchanged.

## Verification

Build and run the Credit suite from the repository root:

```sh
npm run build
PGHOST=127.0.0.1 PGPORT=5433 PGUSER=credit_service PGPASSWORD=credit_service_local PGDATABASE=credit_service npm test --workspace @foc/credit-grpc
npm test --workspace @foc/grpc
```

The last recorded Credit build and all 103 Credit checks passed after the entry-ID
bookmark change. The shared gRPC suite previously passed 51 checks. These are
recorded results, not a new test run for this README update; detailed outputs and
older Docker/live-broker runs are in [the usage log](ai/usage-log.md).
Root `npm test` runs the shared gRPC suite; use the Credit workspace command above
for Credit tests. Without PGDATABASE, the database integration checks skip.

Tests cover migrations and rollback, initial-allocation duplicates, full atomic
rollback, no overspend, version conflicts, settle/release races, opposing
settlements, exact history links/deltas, entry-ID pagination, late writes,
authentication, error trailers and public health. Migration 009's upgrade test
verifies populated-row preservation and operations after timestamp removal.

The shared [SQL ledger oracle](test/sql/ledger-violations.sql) returns violating
rows for explicitly scoped scenario users/reservations (empty means pass).
It checks order/actor links, held amounts, reservation versions, terminal history,
account/history sums and conservation. The [seeded scenario](test/ledger-invariants.test.cjs)
uses four accounts, six workers within a six-connection pool, and four default
seeds with eight rounds of 48 operations each. Checks run after each round drains;
unexpected errors and deadlocks fail, print the seed and stop remaining rounds.
To replay one seed:

```sh
PGHOST=127.0.0.1 PGPORT=5433 PGUSER=credit_service PGPASSWORD=credit_service_local PGDATABASE=credit_service CREDIT_INVARIANT_SEED=12825 node --test credit-service/test/ledger-invariants.test.cjs
```

The separate live-listener test requires a disposable broker with no other
consumers. It tests registration, duplicate events, retries, dead-letter handling
and restart using a temporary database schema and actual Credit startup:

```sh
npm run build
docker run -d --name credit-listener-test -p 127.0.0.1:5674:5672 rabbitmq:3-management
docker exec credit-listener-test rabbitmq-diagnostics -q ping
PGHOST=127.0.0.1 PGPORT=5433 PGUSER=credit_service PGPASSWORD=credit_service_local PGDATABASE=credit_service RABBITMQ_TEST_URL=amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5674 node --test credit-service/test/listener.integration.cjs
docker rm -f -v credit-listener-test
```

Wait for the broker ping to succeed before running the test. This file is outside
the default test glob and refuses to proceed if the Credit queue is already in
use. It never purges an existing queue. Integration tests clean up their schemas,
listeners and child processes. Agent-run checks do not establish human review.
