# Credit service

Credit Service manages credit accounts, reservations and history using PostgreSQL
17 and `pg` with explicit SQL migrations. User registration events grant 10 credits
once per user ID. Order Service uses authenticated plaintext gRPC; the frontend
uses JWT-authenticated REST for each user's own balance and history.

| Interface | Address / path | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gRPC | Port 50054, six RPCs listed below | Order Service token |
| REST balance | GET `/credits/me/balance` on port 3004 | User JWT |
| REST history | GET `/credits/me/history` on port 3004 | User JWT |
| Health | GET `/health` on port 3004 | Public |
| User events | RabbitMQ queue `credit.user-events` | `user.created` consumer |

The current implementation has entry-ID page tokens, direct service-token
comparison, and no account/reservation timestamp columns. Archival, restoration
and deletion are deferred. The human's definitions and AI records are retained in
[the usage log](ai/usage-log.md).

The workspace is `credit-service/`, named `@foc/credit-grpc`. TypeScript builds
into `dist/`; `src/index.ts` starts REST, gRPC and the event consumer.
`migrations/run-migrations.cjs` applies all pending migrations (run by the
`credit-migrate` job); `migrations/apply-migration.cjs` applies one file by hand.
Local `scripts/` and `docs/` are not required by a fresh clone.

## Business operations

- `initCredits({ userId })` is an internal method used by the `user.created`
  callback. New accounts receive 10 total/0 reserved credits exactly once per
  userId, with an `INITIAL_GRANT` history row and saved result in one transaction.
  Matching saved successes replay; confirmed prior grants without saved results
  succeed without writes. An existing account lacking grant evidence fails with
  `ALREADY_EXISTS` and no changes.
- `getBalance` returns userId, total, reserved, and computed available credits. A missing
  account fails; reads never initialize an account.
- `reserveCredits` creates a lifetime-unique reservation per order, holds credits,
  records `RESERVED`, and starts version at 1. Insufficient credits fail without
  changes. Without a saved result, an existing matching requester/amount returns
  the current reservation in any status without writes. A mismatch fails with
  `REQUEST_CONFLICT`.
- `updateReservation` takes the new total held and expected version. It checks
  saved result, existence, active status, matching version, changed amount, then
  available credits for an increase. It applies only the difference, increments
  version, and records signed `RESERVATION_UPDATED` deltas. Unchanged amounts are rejected.
- `releaseCredits` decreases reserved credits only, marks `RELEASED`, increments
  version, and records `RELEASED`. Settled reservations fail. An already released
  reservation without a saved result returns its current state without writes.
- `settleCredits` atomically decreases the requester's total and reserved credits,
  increases the courier's total, sets `SETTLED`/courier/version, and writes
  `TRANSFER_OUT` and `TRANSFER_IN`. Missing courier accounts and self-settlement
  fail without changes. Courier assignment is validated by Order Service. Without
  a saved retry result, an already SETTLED reservation returns its current state
  without writes when the courier matches; a different courier fails with
  FAILED_PRECONDITION/REQUEST_CONFLICT. RELEASED reservations fail with INVALID_STATE.
- `getReservation` reads the full current reservation, including its IDs, amount,
  status, courier and version. Missing reservations fail with `NOT_FOUND`.

Mutations own one READ COMMITTED transaction. Lock order is retry key, order
resource (account resource for initialization), then account rows in ascending
user-ID order. Accounts remain locked through history insertion and commit.
The repository never commits or rolls back. Any failure rolls back account,
reservation, history, and retry-result changes together.

Saved successful retries replay before current-state checks. Mutation replies
are snapshots of the state immediately after that operation. An identical reserve
retry after an update can therefore return the original amount/version/status;
call GetReservation to obtain the full current reservation. Existing
missing-result fallback rules above remain unchanged. The operation-scoped
key is userId for initialization, orderId for reserve/release/settle, and
JSON `[orderId, expectedVersion]` for updates. SHA-256 request hashes use the
human's validated-field arrays; caller identity and metadata are excluded.
See [the exact definitions](ai/prompts/014-business-rules-and-implementation-design.md).
The [advisory-lock encoder](src/repos/advisoryLockKey.ts) hashes UTF-8
JSON `[namespace, key]` and converts its first eight bytes to a signed big-endian
64-bit decimal string, following [exchange 019](ai/prompts/019-advisory-lock-key-encoding.md).
PostgreSQL [transaction-level advisory locks](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADVISORY-LOCKS)
release at transaction end.

## Initial-allocation implementation

Credit accepts this `user.created` payload from User Service's event transport:

```json
{
  "type": "user.created",
  "eventId": "registration-event-id",
  "occurredAt": "2026-10-22T00:00:00.000Z",
  "userId": "registered-user-id"
}
```

The [user.created callback and registration helper](src/events/userCreated.ts)
validate deliveries with the shared `userEventSchema`, verify matching delivery
and payload event IDs, and allocate through `initCredits({ userId })`. Allocation
uniqueness remains per userId. Malformed events, unsupported lifecycle types and
inconsistent prior allocations become NonRetryableError; other failures propagate to the shared client's
retry/dead-letter handling. A successful handler finishes only after the allocation
transaction commits or an existing grant is confirmed. Duplicate event IDs or
different events for the same user cannot grant credits again.

The [consumer helper](src/events/broker.ts) creates one RabbitMQClient for
CREDIT_USER_QUEUE using serviceName credit-service and prefetch 10. Configure
RABBITMQ_URL: host execution
defaults to `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672`; the Docker example reaches a broker
published on the Docker host. Supply a URL reachable from your chosen deployment.
After both API listeners start, `index.ts` attempts consumer startup in the
background with the same CreditService instance. Failed connection, registration
or package-load attempts retry indefinitely after 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and then 30 seconds,
remaining capped at 30 seconds. Each failed startup attempt logs its error message
and next delay once; the REST and gRPC APIs keep running. Connection attempts
reuse the same client. Once connected, Credit registers its consumer and exits
the startup retry loop. The shared client's existing reconnect loop handles later
disconnects and restores its registered consumers.

SIGINT/SIGTERM cancel a pending startup retry wait and prevent further attempts.
Shutdown closes both API listeners, waits for an in-flight startup operation,
closes the broker, then ends the database pool. A connection that finishes during
shutdown is closed without registering a consumer. A broker close failure is
logged and does not skip database cleanup.

`@foc/messaging` is now included as a local workspace and Credit dependency;
root builds, Credit predev and the Docker image build it before Credit. The
package was copied from `origin/events/data-validation` at
`0b48f5f85be01d148176a6410c9ca22c2b8e672e`. **Broker implementation and contracts
are authored by @sunpterodactyl and the shared messaging contributors.** This PR
includes their code for integration/testing and does not claim its authorship.
The [package README](../shared/messaging/README.md) records the import and original
AI declarations. Credit-specific work includes consumer wiring/tests and the
human-requested shared-client `isConnected` getter used for live listener health.
User Service publication remains owned by its implementer. There is no InitCredits RPC.

## gRPC authentication and errors

The shared [credit.proto](../shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto) exposes:

| RPC | Request fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GetBalance | userId | userId, totalCredits, reservedCredits, availableCredits |
| ReserveCredits | orderId, requesterId, amount | Full reservation |
| UpdateReservation | orderId, amount, expectedVersion | Full reservation |
| ReleaseCredits | orderId | Full reservation |
| SettleCredits | orderId, courierId | Full reservation |
| GetReservation | orderId | Full current reservation |

A full reservation contains orderId, requesterId, amount, status, optional courierId,
reservationId and version. Shared TypeScript clients use camelCase; protobuf field
names use snake_case. Initialization is event-driven and history is REST-only.

The six order-only RPCs are GetBalance, ReserveCredits, UpdateReservation,
ReleaseCredits, SettleCredits, and GetReservation. The caller supplies
`x-credit-service-token` metadata. Credit derives service identity from its
configured secret using direct string equality. Missing/unknown or
multiple tokens yield `UNAUTHENTICATED`; a known unauthorized service yields
`PERMISSION_DENIED`. Only the order-service secret is configured at startup.

Set `CREDIT_ORDER_SERVICE_TOKEN` to the same secret on Credit and Order Service.
Credit gRPC always uses plaintext on port 50054 (or the configured GRPC_PORT).
Order uses the shared client's default plaintext credentials and sends
x-credit-service-token. There are no Credit TLS configuration variables.
CREDIT_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH is still required for REST user-token verification.

Business errors preserve gRPC codes and the `x-credit-error-reason` trailer:
ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND, RESERVATION_NOT_FOUND, INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS, VERSION_CONFLICT,
INVALID_STATE, or REQUEST_CONFLICT. Invalid IDs/amounts fail before connecting to
the database. Order IDs must be lowercase hyphenated UUIDs. Amounts and expected
versions are positive int32 integers. IDs must be nonempty, at most 128 characters,
with no leading/trailing whitespace or control characters.
Database serialization/deadlock/lock failures map to
ABORTED; connection failures map to UNAVAILABLE; unknown failures map to INTERNAL.
Only the dedicated ValidationError maps to INVALID_ARGUMENT (or REST 400).
Unexpected errors, including ordinary TypeError, return generic INTERNAL/500
messages and are logged with the original error on the server. Known business,
authentication and transient error mappings are preserved.

The shared Credit client preserves codes/trailers and retries only UNAVAILABLE,
ABORTED and DEADLINE_EXCEEDED using an application loop.
The defaults are three total attempts within one 1,300 ms budget; the backoff base
starts at 50 ms, doubles, caps at 500 ms, and each wait is half the base plus a
random amount up to half the base. Every attempt uses the remaining budget.
Earlier upstream deadlines apply; delays that consume the remaining time are
skipped, and no retry starts after expiration. The last error is returned unchanged.
Client/per-call overrides are documented in the
[shared client reference](../shared/grpc/README.md#credit-client-retries), including
the existing timeoutMs override and maxAttempts/initialDelayMs/backoffMultiplier/
maxDelayMs. Other service client behavior is unchanged.

## Health

Public GET `/health` on port 3004 runs `SELECT 1` and reports live listener readiness:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "db": "up", "listener": "up" }
```

| Database | Listener readiness | HTTP | Overall status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| up | up or down | 200 | ok |
| down | up or down | 503 | degraded |

The listener is down before initial registration, while disconnected or recovering,
and during shutdown. It becomes up after initial registration or after the shared
client reconnects and finishes restoring its consumers. Credit reads the shared
client's `isConnected` getter; it does not actively probe RabbitMQ. Consumer
cancellation on an otherwise open channel is not detected by this getter.
Listener readiness remains informational: database health alone controls HTTP
status and overall status. No token is required.

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3004/health
```

Compose healthchecks both `credit-db` (`pg_isready`) and `credit-service` (this
`/health` endpoint, which must return 200).

## Frontend REST and user history

GET `/credits/me/balance` returns userId, totalCredits, reservedCredits, and
availableCredits. GET `/credits/me/history` accepts optional pageSize and
pageToken and returns entries and nextPageToken (null on the last page).
Responses use camelCase, string IDs, ISO UTC timestamps, integer credits, and
null optional links. History entries and pagination tokens omit the internal
sequenceId. Each nextPageToken is the base64url-encoded UUID of the last entry
returned on that page.

Both routes require `Authorization: Bearer <user token>`. Credit verifies the
User Service RSA public key, RS256 only, a subject and an unexpired exp. The
subject selects the user; caller-supplied IDs or admin roles give no extra reach.
Errors have `{ error, message }` fields. Matching GET routes require authentication;
missing/invalid tokens return 401. Route matching happens first, so an unknown
path returns 404 even without a token. Known limitation: unsupported methods
currently return 404 rather than 405, with or without a token.
On matched routes, invalid sizes/bookmarks return 400; missing accounts return 404; transient
service failures return 503; internal failures return 500. Unknown users have
empty history, entries [] and nextPageToken null.

The REST listener runs on port 3004. Set CREDIT_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH to the User
Service public PEM. Local Compose mounts that same file read-only at
/run/credit/user-service-public.pem, defaulting to ../user-service/keys/public.pem
relative to credit-service/. Supply that public file before starting; no private
User Service key is read, mounted, or packaged.

Both history RPCs, their messages/types, and client wrappers have been removed.
User history is REST-only; there is no order-history operation.

History storage/query support is implemented. Entries retain order_id and
reservation_id (nullable for initial grants), both signed deltas, and created_at.
Migration 006 adds an always-generated bigint sequence_id, unique sequence index,
`(user_id, sequence_id DESC)` index, and one INITIAL_GRANT per user via a partial
unique index. There is no order-history method/index. Queries page downward below
the sequence boundary; sequence values stay decimal strings in JavaScript.
Created_at is display-only: PostgreSQL [now()](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-CURRENT)
uses transaction start. The human selected default page size 50, maximum 100,
entry-ID bookmarks, and INVALID_ARGUMENT for invalid sizes/tokens.
Bookmarks encode the last returned entry's UUID as UTF-8 base64url, without JSON,
user ID or sequence ID. On continuation, Credit validates the token and looks up
the private sequence boundary using `WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2`, with user_id
from the authenticated subject. Malformed UUIDs, nonexistent entries and entries
belonging to another user all produce `Invalid history page token` (REST 400).
Old `{ userId, sequenceId }` tokens are rejected. No schema or migration change
is needed. Query pageSize defaults to 50 and must be an integer from 1 to 100.
Pages fetch one extra row; later requests use sequence_id strictly below the
resolved boundary. Sequence values and the existing ordering/index stay internal.

## Setup and configuration

Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to the ignored `credit-service/.env`. Both
Docker Compose and host development read it. Supply User Service's public PEM
before starting Credit (`npm run keys:generate` in user-service). No private User
Service key is needed.

| Configuration | Default / requirement |
| --- | --- |
| CREDIT_ORDER_SERVICE_TOKEN | Required; match Order Service's configured secret |
| CREDIT_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH | `../user-service/keys/public.pem`, relative to credit-service/ |
| RABBITMQ_URL | Host runs: `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672` |
| DOCKER_RABBITMQ_URL | Compose: the broker as seen from the container (`host.docker.internal`) |
| HTTP_PORT / GRPC_PORT | `3004` / `50054` |
| PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD, PGDATABASE | Compose creates `credit-db` from PGUSER/PGPASSWORD/PGDATABASE and publishes it on PGPORT; host runs connect through PGHOST:PGPORT |

### Docker (from credit-service/)

Provide a reachable RabbitMQ broker separately; this Compose file starts the
database, the migration job and Credit:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

| Service | What it is | Where (standalone dev) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `credit-db` | PostgreSQL 17, data in the credit_service_pgdata volume | `127.0.0.1:${PGPORT}` (5433) |
| `credit-migrate` | One-off job: applies new migrations, then exits | — |
| `credit-service` | gRPC + REST | `localhost:50054`, `http://localhost:3004` |

Inside Docker, Credit reaches the database at `credit-db:5432`. Ports are
published by `compose.override.yaml`, which Compose loads only when run from this
folder; the root compose does not load it, so nothing is exposed there.

After source changes, rebuild the image; a previous image does not pick up source
edits automatically:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build credit-service
```

To open psql, stop the stack keeping the data, or reset it:

```sh
docker compose exec credit-db psql -U credit_service -d credit_service
docker compose down       # keep the data
docker compose down -v    # also delete the data
```

### Host development

```sh
npm install                              # from the repository root
npm run dev --workspace @foc/credit-grpc
```

The predev script builds both shared packages.

## SQL migrations

The current tables are credit_accounts, reservations, credit_history and
idempotency_records.

In Docker, the `credit-migrate` job runs `migrations/run-migrations.cjs` on every
`docker compose up`, before `credit-service` starts. It applies every
`migrations/*.sql` in filename order, each in its own transaction, and records
each file in the `credit_migrations` table (filename, applied_at, success).
Files already recorded as successful are skipped; on a failure the file is rolled
back, recorded as unsuccessful, and the run stops. A PostgreSQL advisory lock
prevents two runs from applying migrations at the same time. Databases migrated
by hand before this job existed have no records, so reset them once with
`docker compose down -v`.

To run the same runner from the host against the published database:

```sh
set -a; . ./.env; set +a                 # from credit-service/: export the PG* values
node migrations/run-migrations.cjs
```

`migrations/apply-migration.cjs` (`npm run db:migrate -- <file.sql>`) still applies
a single file in one transaction, without recording it. Both use
PGHOST/PGPORT/PGUSER/PGPASSWORD/PGDATABASE; PGDATABASE must be explicit. Each
migration runs in one transaction, following [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/features/transactions).
Migration 009 requires the updated service queries that omit account/reservation
timestamps.
Migration 004 enforces unique order_id, settled iff courier is set, and distinct
participants. Migration 005 changes the initial label. Migration 006 converts all
remaining legacy labels, adds sequence paging and initial-grant uniqueness, and
replaces the type check with the six human-specified values. Invalid legacy data
causes a full rollback; it is not removed or silently repaired. Idempotency
operation_type values retain init_credits/reserve/update/release/transfer.
Migration 007 enforces credit_amount > 0 and version > 0 in PostgreSQL. History
deltas are checked by type: INITIAL_GRANT exactly (10, 0); RESERVED
(0, positive); RESERVATION_UPDATED (0, nonzero); RELEASED (0, negative);
TRANSFER_OUT (negative, equal negative); TRANSFER_IN (positive, 0).
Each pair is (total_amount_change, total_reserved_change). Existing invalid rows
reject the entire migration without rewriting data.
Migration 008 requires order_id and reservation_id for every non-INITIAL_GRANT
history entry and forbids both links on INITIAL_GRANT. Its partial unique index
on (reservation_id, type) covers RESERVED, RELEASED, TRANSFER_OUT and TRANSFER_IN;
RESERVATION_UPDATED may occur multiple times. Invalid legacy links or duplicate
indexed events reject the entire migration; no data is repaired or deleted.
Migration 009 drops created_at and updated_at from credit_accounts and reservations.
The account model and repository no longer read or write those columns.
credit_history.created_at and idempotency_records.created_at remain. The existing
balance/reservation REST and gRPC response fields are unchanged.

## Verification

Build and run the Credit suite from the repository root:

```sh
npm run build
PGHOST=127.0.0.1 PGPORT=5433 PGUSER=credit_service PGPASSWORD=credit_service_local PGDATABASE=credit_service npm test --workspace @foc/credit-grpc
npm test --workspace @foc/grpc
```

The messaging/Credit builds and all 108 Credit checks passed after the startup
retry change. Lifecycle tests control time to check capped retries, client reuse,
one initial consumer, shutdown cancellation and live health. Shared-client tests
hold consumer recovery pending to verify that readiness remains down until it
finishes. Earlier shared gRPC, Docker and listener results remain in
[the usage log](ai/usage-log.md).
The updated live-listener suite also passed all 10 Node test results against a
dedicated broker and private outage proxy, including startup recovery, later
disconnect recovery and shutdown during backoff.
Root `npm test` runs the shared gRPC suite; use the Credit workspace command above
for Credit tests. Without PGDATABASE, the database integration checks skip.

Tests cover migrations and rollback, initial-allocation duplicates, full atomic
rollback, no overspend, version conflicts, settle/release races, opposing
settlements, exact history links/deltas, entry-ID pagination, late writes,
authentication, error trailers and public health. Migration 009's upgrade test
verifies populated-row preservation and operations after timestamp removal.

The shared [SQL ledger oracle](test/sql/ledger-violations.sql) returns violating
rows for explicitly scoped scenario users/reservations (empty means pass).
It checks order/actor links, held amounts, reservation versions, terminal history,
account/history sums and conservation. The [seeded scenario](test/ledger-invariants.test.cjs)
uses four accounts, six workers within a six-connection pool, and four default
seeds with eight rounds of 48 operations each. Checks run after each round drains;
unexpected errors and deadlocks fail, print the seed and stop remaining rounds.
To replay one seed:

```sh
PGHOST=127.0.0.1 PGPORT=5433 PGUSER=credit_service PGPASSWORD=credit_service_local PGDATABASE=credit_service CREDIT_INVARIANT_SEED=12825 node --test credit-service/test/ledger-invariants.test.cjs
```

The separate live-listener test requires a disposable broker with no other
consumers. A private TCP proxy simulates startup outages and later disconnects
without stopping the broker. It checks health/recovery without a Credit restart,
one restored consumer, registration delivery, duplicates, retries, dead letters,
restart and shutdown during startup backoff using an isolated database schema:

```sh
npm run build
docker run -d --name credit-listener-test -p 127.0.0.1:5674:5672 rabbitmq:3-management
docker exec credit-listener-test rabbitmq-diagnostics -q ping
PGHOST=127.0.0.1 PGPORT=5433 PGUSER=credit_service PGPASSWORD=credit_service_local PGDATABASE=credit_service RABBITMQ_TEST_URL=amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5674 node --test credit-service/test/listener.integration.cjs
docker rm -f -v credit-listener-test
```

Wait for the broker ping to succeed before running the test. This file is outside
the default test glob and refuses to proceed if the Credit queue is already in
use. It never purges an existing queue. Integration tests clean up their schemas,
listeners and child processes. Agent-run checks do not establish human review.
