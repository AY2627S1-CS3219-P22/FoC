## Exact request text

```text
these are the architecture decisions made so far, along with the requirements&#x20;

database of choice for credit service: postgres17
tables: accounts, reservations, history and idempotency_records

this is the class diagram i have thought of so far:
CreditService
Attributes:

Methods:
initCredits(userId)
displayCredit(): 
createReservation()
updateReservation()
releaseReservaion()
transferReservation()
archiveCredit(userID): 
recordReservation(reservationID): records reservation creation, update, release, transfer
displayUserHistory(): method to display entire credit history for one user
displayOrderHistory()
restoreArchivedAccountCredits()

CreditController:
Attributes:

Methods:
reserveCredits()
updateCredits()
releaseCredits()
transferCredits()
initCredits()
archiveCredits()
restoreArchivedCredits()
getCreditBalance()
getUserCreditHistory()
getOrderCreditHistory


CreditRepository: SqlCreditRepository implements CreditRepository
Attributes:

Methods:
saveCreditAccount() 
findByUserId()
saveReservation()
findReservation
saveCreditHistoryEntry()
findCreditHistoryEntry()
saveArchivedBalance()
findArchivedBalance()
CreditAccount
Attributes:   
userID
totalCreditBalance
reservedCreditAmount

Methods:
initAccount(): allocates 10 credits upon registration, instance method
getAvailableBalance(`)`



Reservation
Attributes:   
userID
errandID
reservationID
creditAmount
reservationStatus

Methods:
getReservation()

CreditHistoryEntry
Attributes:   
userID
errandID
id
type
amount
timestamp


methods:


ArchivedBalance
Attributes:   
email
archivedAt
creditAmount

Methods:


IdempotencyRecord: 

Attributes:   
userID
key
timestamp
operationtype
result



you may save this information so we can refer to this as we implement the service. i also need to containerise the service using docker and set up the database and data model first so let's take this implementation step-by-step.

## Attached diagram transcription

The image was supplied inline in chat. No local image path was provided. This
transcription preserves its labels and arrows; it is not a new AI design.

```text
User Service -- init/archive/restore --> Credit Controller
Order Service -- reserve/update/release/settle --> Credit Controller
Frontend/Client -- Get balance/ get history --> Credit Controller
Credit Controller --> Credit Service --> Credit Repository --> SQL Database

SQL Database
credit_accounts, reservations,
credit_history, archived_balances,
idempotency_records
```

## Key assistant clarifications (verbatim)

1. For the schema step, which table names are final? Your text lists accounts, reservations, history and idempotency_records; the diagram lists credit_accounts, reservations, credit_history, archived_balances and idempotency_records. Please confirm the exact list, including where ArchivedBalance is stored.
2. Please provide your finalized column types, primary/foreign keys, constraints/defaults, status/type values, and idempotency key scope/result format. Also specify any persistence or migration tool you have chosen. Your assignment rules reserve these schema/design decisions for you; I can set up Docker and PostgreSQL 17 while these details are pending.
