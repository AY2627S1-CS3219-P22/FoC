## Exact user prompt

```text
i think we need to make some more changes to integrate better with Order Service and to reduce the complexity required in their code to integrate with ours, so:

let's add user_id back to balance, so restore `string user_id = 1;` in `Balance`, and return `userId` from `CreditService.getBalance`

and return the full reservation from GetReservation instead of just status, amount and version. technically, even though they only really need these 3, this would require a separate parser to parse this since it doesnt' return order id and requester id currently so let's change that
```

## Key assistant responses (verbatim)

I’ll restore `userId` in balance responses and make `GetReservation` return the existing full `Reservation` message, then update the generated types, clients, tests, and disclosures.

`CreditService.getReservation` already returns the full reservation internally, so I’ve removed the gRPC field projection and switched the RPC/client to `Reservation`. `Balance.user_id` is restored at field 1, and `getBalance` now returns it. I’m checking the wire tests and service tests.

All 74 credit-service tests and eight shared transport tests pass, including balance IDs and full reservation fields over gRPC. The workspace build passes too. I’m updating the documentation and checking the packaged Docker contract.

## Key outputs

Restored Balance.user_id at field 1, retained the other balance fields and
reserved timestamp fields, and returned userId from CreditService.getBalance.
GetReservation now uses the existing full Reservation message and the controller
returns the service result directly. Removed GetReservationResponse and its
retired generated/compiled artifacts. Regenerated credit types and updated client,
wire/controller/service tests and current docs. REST forwards the service balance;
its response still contains userId and three credit values. Internal initialization
uses Omit<Balance, 'userId'> for its existing result/saved-response shape. No database
migration or mutation/retry behavior changed. Existing human-review markers were
preserved and the new edits explicitly marked pending review.
