## Exact user prompt

```text
for the credit history bookmark, I want to change the history page token so it no longer exposes the internal sequence_id

so the token carries the id of the last entry returned on the page, base64url-encoded so it stays opaque, instead of { userId, sequenceId }.
to continue, the server looks up that entry's sequence_id using the id and the authenticated user (WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2), then pages below it exactly as it does now. sequence_id stays internal for ordering, the index and the query. It never appears in entries or tokens.
an id that is malformed, doesn't exist, or belongs to another user returns the same "Invalid history page token" validation error (REST 400). Old-format tokens are rejected.
no schema or migration change. Page sizes and the response shape stay the same apart from the token contents.

update historyBookmark.ts, the history paging in CreditService, and the repository (a lookup or a subselect in the paging query). Update the related tests and the README sections that say tokens carry the internal boundary.
```

## Key responses and outcomes

- Replaced JSON user/sequence tokens with base64url UTF-8 entry UUIDs; old-format
  tokens rejected. Before paging, Credit resolves the private decimal-string
  sequence boundary through a parameterized entry-ID/authenticated-user lookup.
- Malformed tokens/UUIDs, nonexistent IDs and another user's IDs all produce
  ValidationError('Invalid history page token') and identical REST 400 bodies.
- Paging/defaults/responses retain existing behavior. Sequences stay internal;
  REST entries and tokens contain no sequence ID. No schema or migration change.
- Updated unit/integration tests and README/disclosures. Credit build and all
  103 tests passed, including high-precision ordering, later writes, cross-user
  rejection, old tokens and seeded ledger checks. Existing human edits retained.
- No running-container replacement, commit or push; human review pending.
