# AI usage log

Maintain this credit-service log throughout implementation. Archive substantive prompts
verbatim, including follow-ups and corrections, and record key responses and
actual outcomes. Do not infer human approval from agent-run checks. This log
starts with the exchange below; it does not establish earlier team AI history.
Historical affected-path mentions include three internal reference documents that
were untracked in exchange 031. Those mentions record past work, not required
submission files; retained disclosure content is under this ai directory.

## 001 — Disclosure setup

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-19 23:48 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Mode/scenario:** Documentation generation to record AI assistance before
  credit-service implementation.
- **Exact prompt:** [Original user prompt and supplied repository instruction](prompts/001-disclosure-setup.md).
- **Key response (verbatim):** “I’ll inspect the branch and set up the usage log
  and disclosures. Before writing credit-service code, I’ll need your finalized
  requirements and architecture. I’ll record prompts and key responses, and leave
  author review marked as pending until you confirm it.”
- **Key output:** Added repository instructions for allowed assistance and ongoing
  attribution, created this log and prompt archive, and appended the final README
  AI Use Summary. No service code, schema, interface, architecture, or decision
  rationale was generated.
- **Affected locations:** `AGENTS.md` (instructions), `README.md` (header and final
  section), `ai/usage-log.md`, `ai/prompts/001-disclosure-setup.md`.
- **Agent verification:** Inspected branch/status and existing instruction/README
  files; checked the documentation diff, attribution headers, and relative links.
  No application tests are applicable to this documentation-only change.
- **Human review/edits:** Pending. No author review, correctness validation, team
  agreement, or acceptance is asserted.
- **External sources/licensing:** No external sources or third-party code used.
- **Instruction files used:** User-supplied AGENTS.md instructions; repository root
  `AGENTS.md` and `credit-service/AGENTS.md` (both empty before setup). No skills
  were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Finalized credit-service requirements and architecture
  before implementation; confirmation of human review when completed.

## 003 — Save human requirements/design and set up local containers

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 00:00 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Documentation formatting/archival and Docker configuration
  boilerplate for the existing gRPC scaffold and human-selected PostgreSQL 17.
- **Exact prompt and attachments:** [Request, original class list, diagram
  transcription, attachment links, and clarifications](prompts/003-requirements-and-setup.md).
  Both requirements attachments are archived verbatim inside documentation
  wrappers; their priorities and planned sprints are human-supplied.
- **Key response (verbatim):** “I’ll save your requirements and design as reference
  material, then inspect the existing Docker and credit-service setup. I’ll start
  with the parts your decisions fully specify and flag any schema details that
  still need your input.”
- **Key output:** Added the supplied references under `credit-service/docs/` and
  the exact request under `credit-service/ai/prompts/`. Added Docker configuration
  for the existing credit gRPC workspace, PostgreSQL 17, and local example
  environment values. The existing gRPC interfaces and handlers are unchanged.
  Schema/domain/repository implementation is pending human input on table-list
  discrepancies, types, constraints, values, and persistence/migration tooling.
  No requirements priorities, architecture/design decisions, or decision
  rationales were generated.
- **Affected locations:** `README.md`; `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/Dockerfile`, `credit-service/Dockerfile.dockerignore`,
  `credit-service/compose.yaml`, `credit-service/.env.docker.example`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/reference/functional-requirements.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/reference/nonfunctional-requirements.md`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/003-requirements-and-setup.md`, and this log.
- **Agent verification:** Shared gRPC and credit gRPC TypeScript builds passed;
  Compose configuration validation, Docker build, and container startup passed.
  PostgreSQL reports version 17.11 with database/user `credit_service` and zero
  public application tables. The packaged gRPC client resolves its contract and
  `GetBalance` returns the existing `UNIMPLEMENTED` status. Documentation links,
  attribution headers, verbatim attachment copies, and final README section were
  checked. An initial documentation-check script incorrectly expected an exact
  bare attribution line in Dockerfiles; the check was corrected to recognize
  comment prefixes. Docker daemon access required sandbox escalation and was
  granted. Human environment files were not read or changed. Containers remain
  running at host ports 5433 (PostgreSQL) and 50054 (gRPC). Compose reported
  pre-existing stopped project containers; those were left untouched.
- **Human review/edits:** The user supplied PostgreSQL 17 and the reference design.
  Review of generated Docker configuration and copied documentation remains
  pending. No human validation or team approval is asserted.
- **Sources/licensing:** Consulted the [official PostgreSQL image documentation](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md)
  for PostgreSQL 17 environment/volume configuration and
  [Docker Compose startup documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/startup-order/)
  for health-check ordering. Configuration boilerplate was generated; no
  third-party implementation code was copied. No independent license audit is
  claimed.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Finalized table list and column schema; persistence
  and migration tooling; review confirmation when completed. Questions are
  recorded in the linked exchange archive.

## 004 — Record human schema and idempotency decisions

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 00:20 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Mode/scenario:** Documentation formatting and clarification of human-supplied
  schema details before implementation.
- **Exact prompt and key responses:** [Verbatim human answers and assistant
  clarification questions](prompts/004-schema-decisions.md).
- **Key output:** Recorded the final five-table list, the human's explicit
  deferral of `archived_balances`, supplied column specifications, idempotency
  transaction/retry behavior, and `pg` with SQL migrations. Requested human
  resolution of conflicting user ID types, missing FK/column details, and
  attribution for JSON manifests. No schema/design decisions, rationales,
  implementation code, or database changes were generated in this exchange.
- **Affected locations:** `README.md`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/004-schema-decisions.md`, and this log.
- **Agent verification:** Checked the documentation diff, local links,
  attribution headers, and final README disclosure section. No application tests
  were run for this documentation-only update.
- **Human review/edits:** These decisions were explicitly supplied by the human;
  review of the formatted record remains pending.
- **External sources/licensing:** No external sources or third-party code used.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Answers to the three clarification questions in the
  linked archive before the affected implementation proceeds.

## 005 — Confirm column rules and add pg migration tooling

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 00:40 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Documentation formatting, implementation/boilerplate, and
  integration-test generation for the human-selected `pg` and SQL migrations.
- **Exact prompt and key responses:** [Human answers, JSON attribution approval,
  initial response, and remaining clarification questions](prompts/005-column-rules-and-pg.md).
- **Key output:** Recorded text account IDs, account/reservation FKs, logical
  order references, nullability, integer history balance fields, timezone-aware
  timestamps, and permitted status/operation values. Preserved the human's
  idempotency flow. Deferred archival and archive/restore operation types as
  requested. Added `pg` 8.23.1, a CLI for applying one selected SQL file in a
  transaction, integration checks, and container connection configuration. No
  application DDL or business operations were generated or applied while the
  history `amount`, naming, and default questions remain pending.
- **Affected locations:** `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `package-lock.json`,
  `credit-service/README.md`, `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `credit-service/Dockerfile`, `credit-service/compose.yaml`,
  `credit-service/grpc/package.json`,
  `credit-service/grpc/scripts/apply-migration.cjs`,
  `credit-service/grpc/test/migration.test.cjs`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/005-column-rules-and-pg.md`, and this log.
- **JSON attribution exception:** Human explicitly approved attribution in the
  service README and this log for `credit-service/grpc/package.json` (dependency,
  migration command, and test command) and root `package-lock.json` (npm-generated
  dependency records, including incidental normalization of existing package
  flags). Both are AI-influenced; human review remains pending.
- **Agent verification:** All three migration-tool tests passed against
  PostgreSQL 17, with no skips. The integration check verified committed data,
  visible failure on reapplication without changing committed data, and rollback
  of both table creation and an insert on SQL failure. Its generated test schema
  and temporary SQL files were removed. Shared/credit gRPC builds, Compose config
  validation, and Docker rebuild/start passed. The rebuilt runtime resolved `pg`,
  connected to PostgreSQL 17, included the migration CLI, and returned the
  expected gRPC `UNIMPLEMENTED` response. Database inspection confirmed no public
  application tables and no leftover test schemas. Attribution/link checks and
  the final README disclosure check passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- **Tool access:** The first sandboxed npm install stalled and was interrupted;
  the authorized install with network access succeeded. Docker and local
  database access used granted sandbox escalation. No automatic approval review
  rejection occurred.
- **Human review/edits:** Human supplied the recorded schema decisions and JSON
  exception. Generated implementation, tests, and formatted records await human
  review; passing agent tests do not assert human validation.
- **Sources/licensing:** Consulted [node-postgres connections](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting),
  [node-postgres transactions](https://node-postgres.com/features/transactions),
  and [PostgreSQL 17 constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/ddl-constraints.html).
  Implementation was generated using those API descriptions; no third-party
  implementation code was pasted. npm lockfile metadata identifies `pg` as MIT
  and its added transitive packages as MIT/ISC. No independent licensing audit
  or legal conclusion is claimed.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Whether history retains `amount` alongside the new
  balance fields, whether the latest shorthand renames columns, and required
  value defaults. No component boundaries, public interfaces, schemas, or decision
  rationales were selected by AI.

## 006 — Implement the human-specified initial SQL schema

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 00:48 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation from human-supplied schema, integration-test
  generation, bounded interpretation of supplied shorthand, and documentation.
- **Exact prompt and key response:** [Human history-field, spelling, and default
  answers, implementation response, and shorthand mapping](prompts/006-history-deltas-and-defaults.md).
- **Key output:** Generated `001_initial.sql` for the four currently in-scope
  tables. Used `requestor_id` and `operation_type`; replaced the earlier history
  amount fields with signed integer `total_amount_change` and
  `total_reserved_change`. Added the human's supplied account, timestamp, UUID,
  and status defaults and previously confirmed nullability/FKs/checks. Added the
  migration to the runtime image and PostgreSQL schema integration tests. Archival
  remains deferred; no controller/service/repository business operations were
  implemented.
- **Shorthand interpretation:** Applied the supplied `reserved_credits = 0`
  default to the existing `credit_accounts` column, not a new reservation column.
  Mapped the repeated timestamp defaults to existing account/reservation fields.
  Retained reservation `credit_amount` and application-supplied `requestor_id`;
  no default for `version` was specified, so application supplies it. These
  interpretations were stated to the user and preserved with the exact prompt.
- **Affected locations:** `README.md`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/Dockerfile`, `credit-service/migrations/001_initial.sql`,
  `credit-service/grpc/test/schema.test.cjs`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/006-history-deltas-and-defaults.md`, and this log.
- **Agent verification:** All nine migration/schema tests passed against
  PostgreSQL 17 with no skips. Checks covered four-table/column shape, nullability,
  defaults, nonnegative account invariants, FKs, allowed status/type values, signed
  history deltas, nullable initial-history references, JSONB, and composite
  idempotency key scope. Temporary schemas were removed. Docker rebuild/start
  passed, including shared/credit gRPC compilation. Verified the local public
  schema was empty, then applied `001_initial.sql` through the packaged migration
  CLI. The local database now contains exactly the four agreed tables, with no
  rows or leftover test schemas. Inspected the applied defaults, signed integer
  field types, and required application-supplied version. Attribution headers,
  local links, final README section, and `git diff --check` passed.
- **Human review/edits:** Schema decisions came from the human across exchanges
  004–006. Generated SQL, tests, and shorthand formatting await human review;
  passing agent checks do not assert human validation.
- **Sources/licensing:** Consulted PostgreSQL 17 documentation for
  [signed integer types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/datatype-numeric.html),
  [UUID generation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-uuid.html), and
  [column defaults](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/ddl-default.html).
  No third-party implementation code was copied.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Review of generated artifacts. Business-operation
  implementation and deferred archival are outside this schema step.

## 007 — Align the shared credit contract and reservation schema

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 08:49 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation from human-specified schema changes,
  generated-type regeneration, test generation, debugging, and documentation.
- **Exact prompt and key responses:** [Original request and clarification
  questions](prompts/007-align-credit-contract.md). The subsequent human answers
  are recorded in entry 008.
- **Key output:** Generated and applied migration 002 to rename reservation
  `requestor_id` to `requester_id` and convert stored `transferred` to `SETTLED`.
  Kept migration 001 unchanged after its earlier application. Aligned existing
  four-RPC message fields with the previously supplied schema: `credit_amount`,
  account totals/timestamps, reservation ID/version/timestamps, nullable courier
  presence, and caller-generated mutation idempotency keys. Changed idempotency
  comments from order-only to the human's operation/key scope. Regenerated six
  TypeScript files, retained their generated source comments, and added AI
  attributions. Retained existing protobuf field numbers and enum numbers.
  No additional RPC methods or credit business operations were implemented.
- **Affected locations:** `shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto`,
  `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit/{Balance,ReleaseCreditsRequest,Reservation,ReserveCreditsRequest,SettleCreditsRequest}.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/test/credit-contract.test.cjs`,
  `shared/grpc/test/transport.test.cjs`, `shared/grpc/README.md`,
  `credit-service/migrations/002_align_credit_contract.sql`,
  `credit-service/grpc/test/schema.test.cjs`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`, `README.md`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/007-align-credit-contract.md`, and this log.
- **Agent verification:** Proto generation and the full workspace build passed.
  Ten database tests passed, including an existing migration-001 schema upgraded
  with renamed requester fields and converted terminal statuses without losing
  IDs, amounts, or version values. Seven shared transport/contract tests passed,
  including credit amount/key transport, totals, timestamps, optional courier
  presence, and settled status. Docker rebuild/start passed; applied migration
  002 to the local database and inspected the requester column and check.
- **Debugging outcome:** Initial `npm test` had six passes and one failure:
  a pre-existing test expected the now-implemented User Service public-profile
  RPC to return `UNIMPLEMENTED` and attempted to access unavailable User Service
  PostgreSQL. Corrected that test to check missing-ID validation without a
  database call. The suite then passed seven of seven; no User Service code was
  changed.
- **Human review/edits:** Schema rename/terminal-status changes and contract
  alignment were requested by the human. Generated changes await human review.
  The broader casing/scope answers arrived during this work and are captured in
  entry 008; no response was assumed from the preselected options. Preserved the
  human's existing `Human Reviewed.` marker in `credit-service/README.md` for its
  earlier content and separately marked these new additions as pending review.
- **Sources/licensing:** Consulted the [Protobuf message-update documentation](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#updating)
  and [PostgreSQL 17 ALTER TABLE reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-altertable.html).
  No third-party implementation code was pasted. Generated types came from the
  existing repository generator and the assisted proto change.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Review and the wider RPC specification described in
  entry 008. Status casing was resolved explicitly by the human in entry 008.

## 008 — Confirm uppercase statuses and defer wider RPC additions

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 08:54 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation/test updates from a human-confirmed schema
  refinement and documentation of future RPC scope.
- **Exact prompt and key response:** [Verbatim uppercase-status and wider-RPC
  answers](prompts/008-status-casing-and-rpc-scope.md).
- **Key output:** Added migration 003 to convert existing reservation status
  values to uppercase, set the default to `RESERVED`, and constrain values to
  `RESERVED`, `RELEASED`, `SETTLED`, matching the existing proto enum labels.
  Updated schema tests/docs to the confirmed final names and values. Additional
  RPCs await the wider human-supplied specification; none were invented.
- **Affected locations:** `credit-service/migrations/003_uppercase_reservation_status.sql`,
  `credit-service/grpc/test/schema.test.cjs`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`, `shared/grpc/README.md`, `README.md`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/008-status-casing-and-rpc-scope.md`, and this log.
- **Agent verification:** All ten database tests passed again with all
  three migrations applied in temporary schemas. Verified upgrade of existing
  reserved/released/transferred rows, rejection of the old lowercase values,
  uppercase default, and preservation of requester relationships. Docker rebuild
  and application of migration 003 passed. Compared the running database's
  status constraint directly with the packaged proto enum: values matched
  exactly. Verified the live `requester_id` column, uppercase default, updated
  reserve request shape, and absence of leftover test schemas. Attribution,
  local-link, final README section, and `git diff --check` checks passed.
- **Human review/edits:** Human explicitly chose all three uppercase values and
  stated that a wider RPC specification will follow. Generated artifacts await
  human review.
- **Sources/licensing:** PostgreSQL ALTER TABLE documentation already consulted
  in entry 007; no third-party implementation code was copied.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Wider RPC request/response specification and review
  of the generated artifacts. No new architecture, interfaces, or rationales were
  proposed for those future endpoints.

## 009 — Record the human-decided nine-RPC list and prepare request messages

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 08:58 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Bounded requirements/contract interpretation and formatting,
  implementation from human-finalized request fields, generated-type regeneration,
  and documentation.
- **Exact prompt and key response:** [Verbatim RPC list, initial response, and
  clarification questions](prompts/009-finalized-rpc-list.md).
- **Key output:** Recorded the human's nine-method list in its supplied order.
  Changed the external reserve/reservation amount field from interim
  `credit_amount` to the now-specified `amount`, retaining field number 3; SQL
  remains `credit_amount`. Prepared request messages for `InitCredits`, user/order
  history with optional pagination fields, `UpdateReservation` with
  `expected_version`, and `GetReservation`. Regenerated eleven affected/new credit
  TypeScript files and restored their attribution headers. Existing four service
  declarations, responses, and idempotency keys remain pending the human's
  remaining response/key definitions. No new response shapes, pagination
  policies, service boundaries, or business logic were chosen or implemented.
- **Affected locations:** `shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto`,
  `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit/{Balance,ReleaseCreditsRequest,Reservation,ReserveCreditsRequest,SettleCreditsRequest,InitCreditsRequest,GetUserCreditHistoryRequest,GetOrderCreditHistoryRequest,UpdateReservationRequest,GetReservationRequest}.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/test/credit-contract.test.cjs`,
  `shared/grpc/test/transport.test.cjs`, `shared/grpc/README.md`,
  `credit-service/README.md`, `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `README.md`, `credit-service/ai/prompts/009-finalized-rpc-list.md`, and this log.
- **Agent verification:** Proto generation, the full workspace TypeScript build,
  and all seven shared transport/contract tests passed. Docker rebuild/start
  passed; verified the packaged five new request definitions, `amount` wire
  serialization, and the reachable existing scaffold endpoint. Attribution,
  local-link, final README disclosure, and `git diff --check` checks passed.
  No SQL, migration,
  dependency, or database state changes were required; database tests were not
  repeated for these contract-only changes.
- **Human review/edits:** RPC names, core request fields, and described behavior
  were supplied by the human. Responses not fully specified by the human have
  not been invented. Existing reviewed README content was preserved; new edits
  remain pending review.
- **Sources/licensing:** Used the existing repository generator and loader;
  Protobuf documentation previously recorded in entry 007 supplies the field
  number/optional-field conventions. No third-party implementation code was
  copied or new external source consulted.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Initialization/mutation/reservation/history response
  definitions, history list/token names and entry fields, caller idempotency-key
  placement in the latest signatures, and whether GetBalance retains its prior
  user/timestamp response fields.

## 010 — Implement finalized response shapes and internal-key request signatures

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 09:16 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation from human-finalized interfaces, generated
  scaffolding/types, transport-test updates, and documentation formatting.
- **Exact prompt and key response:** [Verbatim response/internal-key answers,
  initial response, and targeted follow-up questions](prompts/010-response-shapes-and-internal-keys.md).
- **Key output:** Removed caller idempotency-key fields. Trimmed balance to its
  three balances and mutation responses to the seven human-specified reservation
  fields, reserving removed protobuf numbers/names. Added read-only
  `GetReservationResponse` with exactly status/amount/version. Added
  `UpdateReservation` and `GetReservation` RPC declarations, existing-style Promise
  wrappers, and `UNIMPLEMENTED` handler entries. Added all eight history-table
  fields to `CreditHistoryEntry`, preserving nullable IDs and signed deltas.
  Recorded once-only first-registration initialization with 10 credits, without
  implementing business logic or choosing its unspecified response payload.
  Initialization/history page RPC declarations remain pending their final
  payload definitions; internal retry recognition remains a human decision.
- **Affected locations:** `shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto`,
  `shared/grpc/src/clients.ts`, `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit/{Balance,CreditService,Reservation,ReserveCreditsRequest,ReleaseCreditsRequest,SettleCreditsRequest,InitCreditsRequest,GetUserCreditHistoryRequest,GetOrderCreditHistoryRequest,UpdateReservationRequest,GetReservationRequest,GetReservationResponse,CreditHistoryEntry}.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/grpc/server.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/test/credit-contract.test.cjs`,
  `shared/grpc/test/transport.test.cjs`, `shared/grpc/README.md`,
  `credit-service/README.md`, `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `README.md`, `credit-service/ai/prompts/010-response-shapes-and-internal-keys.md`,
  and this log.
- **Agent verification:** Proto regeneration, the full workspace build, and all
  seven shared transport/contract tests passed. Tests exercised exact balance
  fields, exact mutation fields, nullable courier presence, absence of caller
  keys, amount/version transport, and exact read-only reservation response;
  newly declared scaffold endpoints return `UNIMPLEMENTED`. Docker rebuild/start
  passed. Runtime checks confirmed exact balance/lookup response fields, removed
  caller keys, and both new unimplemented endpoints. Attribution headers/log
  pointers, local links, final README section, and `git diff --check` passed. No database
  schema, dependency, or data changes were required, so database tests were not
  repeated.
- **Attribution maintenance:** Restored headers on three regenerated request
  files whose bodies reverted to their original baseline when caller keys were
  removed, as well as other affected generated files. Preserved generated source
  comments and the human's existing README review marker; current edits remain
  pending human review.
- **Human review/edits:** The human specified exact responses, all-table history
  entries, once-only registration behavior, and internal key generation,
  superseding the earlier caller-key choice. No unprovided InitCredits response,
  page wrapper, or internal retry-identification design was selected by AI.
- **Sources/licensing:** Used existing repository client/scaffold/generator
  conventions and previously consulted Protobuf documentation (entry 007).
  No third-party implementation code was pasted or new external source consulted.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Success payload for InitCredits; history-page list
  and next-token field names; logical-retry recognition for internal keys before
  business implementation; review of generated changes.

## 011 — Add shared history paging and record deterministic-key/initialization rules

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 09:44 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation/type regeneration from human-finalized
  history interfaces, transport-test generation, documentation, and explanation
  of the human's original-response replay rule.
- **Exact prompt and key response:** [Verbatim initialization/history/key answers,
  initial response, targeted questions, and replay explanation](prompts/011-init-outcomes-and-deterministic-keys.md).
- **Key output:** Added `CreditHistoryPage` with the human's `entries` and
  `next_page_token`, reused by both history RPCs. Added their declarations,
  existing-style Promise wrappers, and `UNIMPLEMENTED` handler entries. Preserved
  all eight entry fields, signed deltas, nullable references, and optional request
  pagination. Regenerated/attributed fifteen credit TypeScript files. Recorded
  the human's deterministic request-key recomputation, operation/key lock,
  lookup/hash comparison, original-result replay, and atomic-save flow without
  choosing or implementing a hash/lock mechanism. Recorded first-registration
  allocation failure/delay handling and no second initial grant on duplicates or
  future restoration. Initialization result fields/values, gRPC failure codes,
  duplicate-result semantics, and `SHA-26` name remain pending clarification.
- **Affected locations:** `shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto`,
  `shared/grpc/src/clients.ts`, `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit/{Balance,CreditService,Reservation,ReserveCreditsRequest,ReleaseCreditsRequest,SettleCreditsRequest,InitCreditsRequest,GetUserCreditHistoryRequest,GetOrderCreditHistoryRequest,UpdateReservationRequest,GetReservationRequest,GetReservationResponse,CreditHistoryEntry,CreditHistoryPage}.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/grpc/server.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/test/credit-contract.test.cjs`,
  `shared/grpc/test/transport.test.cjs`, `shared/grpc/README.md`,
  `credit-service/README.md`, `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `README.md`, `credit-service/ai/prompts/011-init-outcomes-and-deterministic-keys.md`,
  and this log.
- **Agent verification:** Proto generation, full workspace build, and all eight
  shared transport/contract tests passed. History tests verified shared page/entry
  shapes, list order preservation over the wire, page-size/token presence,
  metadata forwarding, negative deltas, timestamps, and nullable IDs. Stub tests
  verified all eight declared credit endpoints remain unimplemented. Docker
  rebuild/start passed. Runtime inspection confirmed both history stubs, the
  common page message, signed deltas, and nullable IDs. Hash-name inspection
  reported `sha256` available and `sha26` unavailable; no algorithm was selected
  or implemented. Attribution/log-pointer, local-link, final README section, and
  `git diff --check` checks passed. No database schema or state changes were required; database tests
  were not repeated for this contract-only change.
- **Human review/edits:** The human selected the shared page/entry and exact
  field names, deterministic-key/locking flow, original-response replay, and
  initialization behavior. Generated code/docs await human review. No hash,
  concrete lock strategy, initialization result schema, retry strategy, or
  response-code policy was selected by AI.
- **Sources/licensing:** Consulted [Stripe's idempotency documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/idempotent_requests)
  specifically for API v1 original-response replay, and
  [Node.js hash API documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptogethashes)
  for supported-hash inspection. The replay explanation describes the human's
  rule; no Stripe error caching, retention, key generation, or other policies were
  adopted. No third-party implementation code was copied.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Confirm the hash algorithm; define initialization
  payload fields/types/values and any gRPC failure codes; specify duplicate
  initialization's result versus the general original-response replay rule;
  review the generated artifacts. Concrete pagination/locking details remain
  for the subsequent business-implementation step.

## 012 — Complete InitCredits contract and record SHA-256/saved-success replay

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 09:52 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation/type regeneration from human-finalized
  initialization interface, client/scaffold boilerplate, transport-test updates,
  and documentation formatting.
- **Exact prompt and key response:** [Verbatim SHA-256 confirmation, duplicate
  initialization outcome, payload, and implementation response](prompts/012-init-payload-and-sha256.md).
- **Key output:** Added `InitCredits` with `InitCreditsResponse` containing exactly
  `user_id`, `total_credits`, `reserved_credits`, and `available_credits`. Added its
  existing-style Promise client wrapper and unimplemented handler, completing
  all nine human-decided RPC declarations/wrappers/stubs. Regenerated and
  attributed sixteen credit TypeScript files. Recorded SHA-256 and the explicit
  rule that duplicate initialization returns the original saved success without
  granting again. No separate status flags, application error-code mapping,
  hashing/locking code, or allocation logic was introduced.
- **Affected locations:** `shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto`,
  `shared/grpc/src/clients.ts`, `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit/{Balance,CreditService,Reservation,ReserveCreditsRequest,ReleaseCreditsRequest,SettleCreditsRequest,InitCreditsRequest,InitCreditsResponse,GetUserCreditHistoryRequest,GetOrderCreditHistoryRequest,UpdateReservationRequest,GetReservationRequest,GetReservationResponse,CreditHistoryEntry,CreditHistoryPage}.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/grpc/server.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/test/credit-contract.test.cjs`,
  `shared/grpc/test/transport.test.cjs`, `shared/grpc/README.md`,
  `credit-service/README.md`, `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `README.md`, `credit-service/ai/prompts/012-init-payload-and-sha256.md`,
  and this log.
- **Agent verification:** Proto generation, full workspace build, and all eight
  shared transport/contract tests passed, including exact initialization payload,
  metadata forwarding, no caller key, and reachability of all nine unimplemented
  credit endpoints. Docker rebuild/start passed. Packaged runtime checks verified
  all nine RPC declarations, the exact initialization response, exclusion of caller
  keys, and the reachable unimplemented initialization handler. File attribution,
  log-pointer, local-link, final README section, and `git diff --check` checks
  passed. These checks verify contract transport/scaffolding, not
  initial allocation or duplicate replay business behavior. No database schema,
  dependency, or data changes were required; database tests were not repeated.
- **Human review/edits:** The human selected SHA-256, the exact four-field
  initialization payload, and original-success replay on duplicate initialization,
  resolving the earlier questions. Code/docs remain pending human review;
  existing human-reviewed README content was preserved.
- **Sources/licensing:** Existing repository generator/client/scaffold conventions
  and previously recorded Protobuf references were used. No new external source
  was consulted and no third-party implementation code was copied.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Review of generated artifacts. Concrete pagination,
  locking, and operation/error details remain for the later business-implementation
  step; no further success-payload clarification is required for this contract.

## 014 — Record business definitions and implement reservation constraints

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 11:30 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Formatting human-supplied business/implementation definitions,
  bounded consistency review and technical explanation, implementation and
  PostgreSQL tests for explicitly finalized schema constraints.
- **Exact prompt and key responses:** [Business rules/design, hash inputs,
  transaction flow, access rules, and clarification questions](prompts/014-business-rules-and-implementation-design.md).
- **Key output:** Recorded latest edge cases, version/error/validation rules,
  controller/service/repository responsibilities, READ COMMITTED transaction and
  lock order, distinct key/hash definitions, deferred client retries, and requested
  concurrency tests. Recorded the human's removal of disputes/F8.9.2 from scope.
  Added migration 004 for UNIQUE(order_id), SETTLED iff courier_id is set, and
  courier != requester. Did not choose history type changes, snapshot/cursor
  design, transaction binding, concrete resource locks, service authentication,
  extra enforcement mechanisms, error reason interface, or fallback semantics.
- **Affected locations:** `README.md`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `credit-service/migrations/004_reservation_invariants.sql`,
  `credit-service/grpc/test/reservation-invariants.test.cjs`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/014-business-rules-and-implementation-design.md`, and
  this log. The tested migration was applied to the local development database
  after a read-only check found no violating rows.
  Also updated `shared/grpc/README.md` and comment-only
  `shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto` documentation to distinguish the new plain-ID
  lookup keys from the SHA-256 request hash. Wire definitions/generated types
  were unchanged; regeneration was not required.
- **Agent verification:** All 15 credit migration/schema checks passed against
  PostgreSQL 17 using isolated temporary schemas, with zero skips/failures.
  Verified invalid existing rows roll back the migration without data repair,
  duplicates are rejected for all statuses, settlement/courier consistency and
  participant distinction hold, and preceding account/history/retry writes roll
  back following a constraint error. Temporary schemas were removed.
  Docker rebuild/start passed, including shared/credit TypeScript builds.
  Runtime checks confirmed migration 004 is packaged, all three local constraints
  are validated, and reservation-test schemas were removed. Affected-file header,
  log-pointer, local-link, final README disclosure, service-local AI directory,
  and whitespace checks passed.
  No main business handlers, service retry loop, or requested business-concurrency
  scenarios have been implemented or tested in this change.
- **Human review/edits:** Pending review of generated artifacts. All implemented
  schema constraints were explicitly supplied by the human. No human approval of
  the unanswered questions or generated implementation is inferred.
- **Sources/licensing:** Consulted primary [gRPC authentication](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/),
  [deadlines](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/deadlines/),
  [PostgreSQL 17 explicit locking](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/explicit-locking.html),
  [UUID types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/datatype-uuid.html), and
  [READ COMMITTED visibility](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/transaction-iso.html).
  These support factual explanations, not AI-selected security/locking designs.
  No third-party implementation code was copied.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills were invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Questions archived in exchange 014 about history
  values/pagination, concrete locking and transaction binding, caller/admin
  identity and permissions, error-metadata interface, UUID validation, missing
  retry-record reservation fallback, and database enforcement mechanisms.
  Client retry attempt/backoff/deadline policy remains for the later retry step.

## 015 — Record proposed userCreated-triggered initialization

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 16:41 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Bounded interpretation/formatting of the human's proposed
  change and documentation/disclosure maintenance.
- **Exact prompt and key response:** [Proposed event workflow and response](prompts/015-proposed-user-created-initialization.md).
- **Key output:** Recorded that the human and User Service are considering a
  userCreated event as the initialization trigger. Related the proposal to the
  existing one-time/atomic grant and missing-account read rules. Identified event
  contract/transport, publication/processing/acknowledgment behaviour, replacement
  scope, and restoration distinction as human decisions before implementation.
  No architecture recommendations, event schema, broker, acknowledgment/retry
  strategy, or decision rationale was generated.
- **Affected locations:** `README.md`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/015-proposed-user-created-initialization.md`, and
  this log.
- **Agent verification:** Read repository instructions and current recorded
  decisions. Documentation attribution, pointers/links, final root README section,
  service-local records, and whitespace checks passed. No implementation, schema, database,
  dependencies, or gRPC wire definitions changed; tests/build were not repeated.
- **Human review/edits:** Pending. The human described the workflow as under
  consideration; this does not establish final authorization of an event design
  or removal of InitCredits.
- **Sources/licensing:** Used repository and human-supplied material only.
  No external source consulted and no third-party code copied.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Final event workflow and contract definitions before
  dependent implementation. Earlier unrelated business-definition questions
  remain as recorded in exchange 014.

## 016 — Confirm user.created scope and remove initialization RPC

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 17:31 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation and type regeneration of the human-decided
  RPC removal, bounded contract/integration verification, transport-test updates,
  and documentation formatting.
- **Exact prompt and key responses:** [Final event scope, delivery rules,
  read-only source inspection, and clarification questions](prompts/016-user-created-event-contract.md).
- **Key output:** Recorded RabbitMQ/shared messaging, the four supplied payload
  fields, acknowledgment after commit/verified prior grant, shared-client failure
  retries, User Service publication ownership, and one grant per userId even
  across different events. Removed InitCredits, its proto request/response,
  Promise wrapper, stub, and two generated types; regenerated/attributed fourteen
  remaining credit TypeScript files. Added exact eight-RPC/no-init-client coverage.
  No event queue, payload details beyond the supplied fields, consumer,
  inconsistent-account outcome, schema, or grant/locking logic was selected or
  implemented. Existing unrelated definitions remain pending.
- **Affected locations:** `README.md`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`, `shared/grpc/README.md`,
  `shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto`, `shared/grpc/src/clients.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/grpc/server.ts`,
  `shared/grpc/test/credit-contract.test.cjs`,
  `shared/grpc/test/transport.test.cjs`,
  `shared/grpc/src/generated/credit.ts` and the thirteen remaining attributed
  generated credit messages/service types, deleted generated InitCreditsRequest.ts
  and InitCreditsResponse.ts, this log, and
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/016-user-created-event-contract.md`.
- **Agent verification:** Proto generation, full workspace build, and all nine
  shared transport/contract tests passed. Docker rebuild/start passed. Packaged
  runtime checks confirmed exactly eight RPCs, no initialization wrapper or
  retired generated message artifacts, and a reachable remaining scaffold.
  All 25 affected-file attributions, log pointers, documentation links, final root
  README disclosure, service-local AI records, and whitespace checks passed.
  No database migrations or business implementation changed;
  database tests were not repeated.
- **Read-only integration inspection:** GitHub CLI was unavailable and browser
  retrieval could not fetch the PR. Fetched refs/pull/57/head from origin for
  inspection only, without checkout or merge; inspected commit
  b8b924db95a60a36f9bc6b8c1880bf5ae96fb939. Verified shared-client ack/retry code
  and default MAX_RETRIES=3. Git tree/grep found no user.created contract/queue/
  publisher in that snapshot or this local branch; no publisher implementation
  is claimed to have been verified.
- **Human review/edits:** The human finalized event-triggered initialization
  and complete InitCredits RPC replacement. Generated code/docs await review.
- **Sources/licensing:** Read the repository and
  [PR 57](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS3219-P22/FoC/pull/57), including its shared
  messaging implementation/README/topology and User Service registration code.
  No PR code was copied or merged. No architecture rationale or additional
  messaging pattern was generated.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Publisher branch/file and exact queue, plus handling
  of an existing account without initial-grant evidence. Earlier history-type,
  lock/transaction and other business implementation definitions remain pending
  as recorded in exchange 014; grant uniqueness per userId is now explicit.

## 017 — Implement the credit-side user.created callback before the publisher

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 21:02 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Callback/registration boilerplate and implementation from
  human-specified event/service behaviour; handler-boundary tests and bounded
  clarification of existing failure semantics.
- **Exact prompts and key response:** [Publisher-first assumption, permanent
  no-write failure, callback response, and questions](prompts/017-consumer-first-and-permanent-failure.md).
- **Key output:** Added user.created event shape, callback, and registration
  helper compatible with the inspected shared consumeFromQueue API. Registration
  accepts a connected shared client and a supplied queue, without selecting a
  queue name or installing/copying the unmerged shared package. The callback waits
  for initCredits completion, passes only userId, validates the supplied identity
  rules, and propagates service failures without successful completion.
  No grant transaction or alternate permanent-error API was selected in this
  initial callback slice; exchange 018 adds the transaction after human answers.
- **Affected locations:** `credit-service/grpc/src/messaging/userCreated.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/test/user-created.test.cjs`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/017-consumer-first-and-permanent-failure.md`,
  `README.md`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`, and this log.
- **Agent verification:** Callback/type build passed. The 19 then-current credit
  checks passed with PostgreSQL enabled, including the existing 15 migration
  checks and four callback-boundary tests. Refreshed PR 57 read-only; head remained
  b8b924db95a60a36f9bc6b8c1880bf5ae96fb939, whose client retries all rejected
  handlers without a permanent-failure special case. No broker was started or
  live acknowledgment/dead-letter routing tested.
- **Human review/edits:** Pending review of generated artifacts. The human
  authorizes implementation before the publisher exists and requires no writes
  or successful acknowledgment for an unconfirmed existing account.
- **Sources/licensing:** Read the previously inspected
  [shared client source](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS3219-P22/FoC/blob/b8b924db95a60a36f9bc6b8c1880bf5ae96fb939/shared/messaging/src/index.ts)
  and repository conventions. No PR code was copied or merged.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills invoked.
- **Remaining human input at this point:** Retry/dead-letter outcome,
  INITIAL_GRANT versus existing label, and concrete lock mechanism; resolved in
  exchange 018 except the namespace/string-to-bigint mapping.

## 018 — Implement INITIAL_GRANT transaction and PostgreSQL advisory locks

- **Timestamp:** Recorded 2026-10-20 21:11 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation and migration generation after human
  finalization, PostgreSQL documentation verification, integration/concurrency
  testing, and disclosure documentation.
- **Exact prompts and key responses:** [Bounded retry then dead-letter,
  INITIAL_GRANT, bigint transaction locks, requested verification, and remaining
  encoding question](prompts/018-initial-grant-and-advisory-locks.md).
- **Key output:** Added the initial-allocation slice of CreditService,
  CreditRepository, and SqlCreditRepository. CreditService owns one READ COMMITTED
  transaction and passes its connection to the repository. The repository locks
  supplied bigint identifiers with pg_advisory_xact_lock, without committing or
  rolling back. The service hashes the specified INIT/userId array, replays saved
  success, or locks the account and inserts account/history/result atomically.
  It confirms a prior grant through saved result or INITIAL_GRANT history,
  logs confirmed existing grants after completion, and fails an unconfirmed
  existing account with ALREADY_EXISTS and no writes. Added migration 005 to
  translate initial history to INITIAL_GRANT; other history/idempotency operation
  values remain unchanged. Declared @types/pg development dependency.
- **Key implementation limit:** A namespace/string-to-bigint encoder is a
  required constructor argument. No production encoding was selected; database
  tests use fixture-only numeric IDs. The callback/registration helper is ready
  for a connected shared client/queue/service, but the application entrypoint
  is not wired to RabbitMQ and no unmerged package was installed or copied.
- **Affected locations:** `README.md`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`, `shared/grpc/README.md`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/messaging/userCreated.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/services/{CreditService,validation}.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/repositories/{CreditRepository,SqlCreditRepository}.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/test/{initial-allocation,user-created}.test.cjs`,
  `credit-service/migrations/005_initial_grant_history_type.sql`,
  `credit-service/grpc/package.json`, `package-lock.json`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/018-initial-grant-and-advisory-locks.md`, and this log.
  JSON attribution uses the human-approved exception from entry 005.
- **Agent verification:** All 31 credit checks passed with PostgreSQL enabled and
  zero skips/failures. Verified migration of legacy history, single atomic grant,
  24 concurrent distinct event deliveries for one user, saved-response replay
  after changed balances, confirmed history without a saved result, no-write
  unconfirmed accounts/hash mismatch, failures at history/result insertion with
  rollback and later retry, actual advisory-lock timeout with rollback/retry,
  and lock release after commit and rollback. Full workspace build passed.
  Docker rebuild/start passed. Runtime verified packaged grant service/repository/
  callback modules, active migration 005, the PostgreSQL bigint advisory function,
  and cleanup of allocation-test schemas. All 15 affected documentation/code file
  headers, log pointers/local links, final README disclosure, service-local AI
  records, and whitespace checks passed.
  The tested migration was applied to the local development database.
  Initial tests without PGDATABASE skipped integration checks; the subsequent
  PostgreSQL-enabled runs passed all checks. No live RabbitMQ delivery was tested.
- **Human review/edits:** Pending review of generated artifacts. The human chose
  INITIAL_GRANT, transaction-level bigint advisory locks, and bounded retry then
  dead-letter. No new permanent-error mechanism or production lock encoding was
  generated as a design choice.
- **Sources/licensing:** Verified
  [PostgreSQL 17 advisory functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADVISORY-LOCKS),
  [transaction-lock lifetime](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS),
  and [node-postgres same-connection transactions](https://node-postgres.com/features/transactions).
  @types/pg 8.23.1 declares MIT in the lockfile. No third-party implementation
  code or PR package was copied/merged.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Exact namespace/key-to-signed-bigint encoding.
  The shared package/queue are eventual integration inputs, rather than a
  prerequisite for the callback/transaction implementation. Other business
  operations and their earlier unresolved definitions remain outside this slice.

## 019 — Implement the human-finalized signed bigint advisory-key encoding

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 22:00 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation from the human's exact algorithm,
  constructor/repository wiring, encoding/concurrency verification, and disclosure
  documentation.
- **Exact prompt and key response:** [Namespace/key JSON, UTF-8 SHA-256, first
  eight signed big-endian bytes, decimal-string SQL argument](prompts/019-advisory-lock-key-encoding.md).
- **Key output:** Added advisoryLockKey and wired every SqlCreditRepository
  advisory-lock call to it. Removed the temporary encoder type/constructor
  injection; CreditService now takes only its pool and the repository only its
  transaction connection. Replaced fixture numeric IDs in allocation/concurrency
  tests with the production mapping. No schema, RPC, namespace values, messaging
  topology, or grant behaviour changed.
- **Affected locations:** `README.md`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/repositories/{CreditRepository,SqlCreditRepository,advisoryLockKey}.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/services/CreditService.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/test/{initial-allocation,advisory-lock-key}.test.cjs`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/019-advisory-lock-key-encoding.md`, and this log.
- **Agent verification:** Full workspace build and all 33 credit checks passed,
  with PostgreSQL enabled and zero skips/failures. Used independent Python
  hashlib/compact JSON/UTF-8/struct.unpack('>q') calculations to generate eight
  fixed vectors covering signs, values beyond Number precision, UTF-8, escaping,
  and namespace/key tuple boundaries. PostgreSQL tests directly contended for
  independently known signed bigint identifiers, confirming exact decimal SQL
  transport and release on commit/rollback. Existing concurrent allocation,
  duplicate replay, rollback, and lock-timeout checks now use the production
  encoder. Docker rebuild/start passed. Packaged runtime checks verified positive
  and negative vectors and cross-connection contention/release on the exact
  decimal bigint. All 11 affected code/documentation attributions, log pointers/
  local links, final README disclosure, service-local AI records, and whitespace
  checks passed. No schema, dependency, or persisted data changes were required.
- **Human review/edits:** The human finalized the complete encoding. Generated
  code/docs await human review; test success does not establish human approval.
- **Sources/licensing:** Used the human's exact algorithm, existing Node crypto/
  Buffer APIs, and previously recorded PostgreSQL references. Python standard
  library was used only to compute independent verification vectors. No new
  external source was consulted or third-party implementation code copied.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** No remaining advisory-key encoding question.
  Live RabbitMQ startup/shared-package integration and the other previously
  recorded business-operation definitions remain outside this encoding change.

## 020 — Begin remaining core credit logic; preserve human design decisions

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-20 22:05 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation of human-finalized balance/reservation
  reads and reservation update behaviour, SQL repository boilerplate, debugging/
  concurrency/rollback checks, bounded clarification of remaining definitions,
  and documentation/disclosure maintenance.
- **Exact prompt and key response:** [Core-logic request, explicit teammate
  integration ownership, implementation response, and clarification questions](prompts/020-remaining-core-business-logic.md).
- **Key output:** Added CreditService getBalance/getReservation/updateReservation,
  service-level error codes and the human's existing VERSION_CONFLICT reason.
  Added account saving, reservation find/create/save, typed reservation results,
  and generic saved-result typing. Added service-owned READ COMMITTED mutation
  handling: retry-key lock/replay, order-resource lock, work, atomic result save,
  commit/rollback. Update validates and follows the supplied check order,
  locks the account before reading its balance, changes reserved credits by
  difference, increments version once, writes signed update history and saves
  the response together. Reads never create accounts or write history.
- **Boundaries:** RabbitMQ startup and User Service implementation are explicitly
  assigned to teammates. No new history enum, UUID-format policy, pagination/
  snapshot design, caller authentication, reason-metadata interface, or missing
  retry-record Reserve fallback was selected. Existing update history value is
  retained. Reserve/release/settle/history and controller wiring await those
  definitions; this entry does not claim all core logic is finished.
- **Affected locations:** `README.md`, `credit-service/README.md`,
  `credit-service/docs/user-decisions.md`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/repositories/{CreditRepository,SqlCreditRepository}.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/src/services/{CreditService,validation}.ts`,
  `credit-service/grpc/test/core-credit.test.cjs`,
  `credit-service/ai/prompts/020-remaining-core-business-logic.md`, and this log.
- **Agent verification:** All 44 credit checks passed with PostgreSQL enabled,
  zero failures/skips. The 11 new core checks verify pre-connection validation,
  no-write balance/reservation reads, signed hold differences, using the existing
  hold when increasing to the full total balance, rejection without state changes,
  replay before version checks, shared-version concurrency, shared-account
  overspend prevention, and injected history/result failures with full rollback
  and later retry. Temporary schemas are removed. Full workspace build and Docker
  rebuild/start passed. Runtime verified packaged core methods, no implicit
  account creation, missing reservation reads, and cleaned core-test schemas.
  Affected-file attributions/log pointers, local links, final README disclosure,
  service-local AI records, and whitespace checks passed. No schema/dependency or
  persisted application-data changes were required.
- **Human review/edits:** Pending review of generated artifacts and answers to
  the recorded remaining behaviour/interface questions. Existing user changes
  are preserved; no reviewer approval is inferred from tests.
- **Sources/licensing:** Used the human's recorded requirements and repository
  implementation conventions. No new external source was consulted or
  third-party implementation code copied.
- **Instruction files used:** Root `AGENTS.md` and empty
  `credit-service/AGENTS.md`. No skills invoked.
- **Remaining human input:** Full history labels, history cursor/snapshot
  semantics, existing-reservation fallback without retry record, UUID validation,
  and controller service identity/history permissions/reason metadata.

## 021 — Implement finalized reservation mutations, history schema, and authentication

- **Timestamp:** Began 2026-10-20 23:45 SGT (UTC+08:00); verification/documentation
  continued into 2026-10-21 00:07 SGT alongside exchange 022.
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation from human-finalized business/schema/access
  definitions, generated contract boilerplate, debugging and integration tests,
  bounded wire-detail clarification, documentation/disclosure maintenance.
- **Exact prompts/key exchanges:** [Four exact answers, key responses, and the
  REST follow-up question](prompts/021-history-and-authentication.md). Original
  questions are in exchange 020; the REST answer is in exchange 022.
- **Key output:** Implemented reserve/release/settle with service-owned READ
  COMMITTED transactions, retry/order/account locks, atomic balances/reservation/
  signed history/results, saved-response replay, exact missing-record fallbacks,
  named error reasons, UUID validation before connection, account ordering, and
  full rollback. Update now writes the human's exact RESERVARTION_UPDATED label.
  Migration 006 converts legacy labels, adds always-generated bigint sequence_id,
  unique/user-desc indexes and a partial unique INITIAL_GRANT index. Applied
  migrations 001–005 were preserved; 006 also handles init_credits for legacy
  input. Idempotency operation names remain unchanged. SQL history querying
  supports sequence boundaries and keeps bigint values as strings.
- **Contract/controller:** Removed both history RPCs, history request/page/entry
  messages, generated files and client wrappers; regenerated remaining credit
  types with attribution restored. Connected six order-only RPCs with secret-
  derived identity, constant-time SHA-256 digest comparison, authentication before
  business logic, reason trailers, transient error mapping, and TLS required
  unless explicit local mode. Added RS256 user-token verification for the
  subsequent REST integration. Configured local service-token/TLS variables.
- **Affected locations:** Root README; credit-service README, usage log, prompt
  archive 021, docs/user-decisions.md, compose.yaml, .env.docker.example,
  grpc/.env.example, grpc/package.json; root package-lock.json;
  credit-service/migrations/006_history_types_and_paging.sql;
  grpc/src/api/{auth,errors,tls}.ts, src/{env,index}.ts,
  src/grpc/server.ts, src/services/{CreditService,validation}.ts,
  src/repositories/{CreditRepository,SqlCreditRepository}.ts;
  tests auth/core-credit/history/initial-allocation;
  shared/grpc README, proto/credit.proto, src/clients.ts,
  src/generated/credit.ts and regenerated/removed credit types,
  test/{credit-contract,transport}.test.cjs. Existing earlier uncommitted work
  was preserved. Exchange 022 subsequently extends the overlapping files.
- **Dependency attribution:** Added jsonwebtoken ^9.0.3 and development
  @types/jsonwebtoken ^9.0.10, matching the existing User Service declarations.
  The human-approved JSON attribution exception is documented in the service
  README and this log. No package manifest header comment was added.
- **Agent verification:** Before REST completion, all 65 credit checks passed
  with PostgreSQL enabled, zero failures/skips; eight shared tests and full
  workspace build passed. Added tests verify parallel reserves/no overspend,
  12 duplicate reserves, missing-record no-write fallbacks in all statuses,
  competing settle/release, opposing settlements without deadlock, missing/self
  couriers, full rollback on the second transfer history row, exact migration
  conversions and rollback for duplicate grants/ambiguous legacy transfers,
  sequence ordering/precision beyond 2^53, writes during paging and late commits,
  six-RPC authentication, unauthorized identities, error trailers, JWT validation,
  and TLS configuration. Scoped coverage before REST was 98.14% lines/94.03%
  branches. Initial sandboxed network tests failed EPERM; reruns with approved
  local listener/database access passed. No such failure was treated as success.
  Migration 006 was applied once to the local development database. Docker
  rebuild/start and no-write runtime token/error/UUID checks passed. After
  exchange 022, the suite has 70 passing credit checks; see below.
- **Human review:** Pending review of generated implementation/docs. The human
  supplied the decisions; agent-run checks do not establish human validation.
  Root AGENTS.md and existing empty credit-service/AGENTS.md were used. No skills
  invoked. No agent delegation, commit, PR, merge, or deployment was performed.
- **Sources/licensing:** Verified PostgreSQL 17
  [identity columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/ddl-identity-columns.html)
  and [transaction timestamps](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-CURRENT),
  [jsonwebtoken verification](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback),
  [Node timingSafeEqual](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptotimingsafeequala-b),
  and [gRPC authentication](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/). Prior PostgreSQL
  advisory-lock references are recorded in entries 018–019. No third-party
  implementation code was copied. No new license-compatibility assurance or
  human review is claimed.
- **Scope:** RabbitMQ startup and User Service implementation remain with
  teammates. REST paths/bookmark shape were left pending until the human's
  answer in exchange 022. No new schema/interface choices filled those gaps.

## 022 — Implement human-finalized own-balance/history REST and bookmarks

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-21 00:01–00:11 SGT (UTC+08:00), with final documentation
  and checks completed during this same session.
- **Tool/model:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6.
- **Modes/scenario:** Implementation after human wire definitions, startup and
  Docker boilerplate, meaningful pagination/authentication tests, documentation.
- **Exact prompt/key response:** [REST paths, fields, bookmark definition, and
  implementation response](prompts/022-rest-wire-details.md).
- **Key output:** Added getUserCreditHistory with default 50/max 100, sequence-
  descending limit+1 queries, scoped bookmarks, and null final token. Added
  strict base64url/UTF-8/JSON decoding: exactly userId/sequenceId, current subject,
  positive digits-only decimal sequence with no leading zeros within signed
  bigint range. Added GET /credits/me/balance and GET /credits/me/history with
  optional pageSize/pageToken, camelCase responses, ISO UTC dates, null links,
  decimal sequenceId, and error/message payloads. The RS256 subject selects the
  user; query IDs and admin claims provide no additional reach. Connected REST
  port 3004 startup/shutdown alongside gRPC 50054. Docker mounts only the User
  Service public PEM read-only, never its private key. No key contents/tokens
  were written to disclosures. Tests generate their own temporary RSA keys.
- **Affected locations:** credit-service/grpc/src/services/{CreditService,
  historyBookmark}.ts; src/api/{rest,errors}.ts; src/index.ts;
  test/{rest,history,auth}.test.cjs; credit-service/Dockerfile, compose.yaml,
  .env.docker.example, README.md, docs/user-decisions.md, ai/usage-log.md and
  prompts/022-rest-wire-details.md; shared/grpc/README.md; root README.
- **Agent verification:** Full workspace build passed. All 70 credit checks
  passed with PostgreSQL and local listeners, no failures/skips. Eight shared
  contract/transport checks passed. New REST/bookmark tests cover malformed,
  extra/missing/wrong-user fields, invalid UTF-8/base64url/JSON, numeric precision/
  signed-bigint bounds, sizes before DB connection, RS256 expiry/subject,
  admin subject isolation, ISO/null serialization, query parsing/errors,
  103-entry paging with 50/100 sizes, writes after page one, unknown-user empty
  history, and service/internal error handling. Scoped Node coverage command:
  `node --experimental-test-coverage '--test-coverage-include=**/credit-service/grpc/src/{services,repositories,messaging,api,grpc}/**/*.ts' --test credit-service/grpc/test/*.test.cjs`
  with local PG variables reported 98.29% lines, 94.44% branches, 98.16% functions.
  Startup/env/generated code is excluded from that report. Docker rebuild/start
  passed; logs confirm both listeners. Runtime no-write checks confirm both REST
  reads reject absent/invalid JWTs with 401 error/message, and authenticated gRPC
  returns NOT_FOUND with ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND trailers. Actual User Service private
  signing keys were not read for runtime tests; successful JWT behavior was
  exercised with generated test keys. Temporary database schemas are removed.
  A final debugging check inspected installed pg-pool/pg connection errors:
  code-less pool acquisition timeout, connection timeout, and unexpected disconnect
  messages now map to UNAVAILABLE as required for transient database failures.
  Assertions were added to the existing error-classification test; all 70 checks
  passed again and the credit build/Docker rebuild passed. Final current-doc link,
  attribution/header pointer, root README last-section, service-local AI location,
  and tracked diff whitespace checks passed. Prompt archives retain original
  trailing whitespace where supplied by the human.
- **Human review:** Pending. Root AGENTS.md and the existing empty service
  AGENTS.md used; no skills invoked. Existing personal env files and teammates'
  implementations were not edited. No commit/merge/publication performed.
- **Sources/licensing:** Used the human's exact wire definitions and existing
  User Service authenticate/error payload conventions. Source references for
  JWT/crypto/PostgreSQL are in entry 021. No copied third-party implementation.
- **Remaining integration:** RabbitMQ startup/User Service event publication are
  explicitly teammate-owned. Application retries in createCreditClient are a
  subsequent requested integration and are not implemented here; finite
  deadlines/codes/trailers are preserved. Archival/restoration remain deferred.

## 025 — Correct history spelling, typed validation, mutation documentation and REST routing

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-21 01:56–02:04 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model and modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; human-directed implementation/
  debugging, meaningful regression tests, bounded clarification, documentation
  and disclosure maintenance.
- **Exact prompt/key exchanges:** [Full request, migration/error confirmations,
  and key responses](prompts/025-validation-routing-and-spelling.md).
- **Human decisions:** Correct RESERVARTION_UPDATED to RESERVATION_UPDATED.
  The human confirms no shared database has applied migration 006; it may be
  edited in place. Existing business/authentication/transient error mappings
  must remain; only unexpected failures use generic INTERNAL/500. Match REST
  routes before authentication; retain unsupported-method 404 as the requested
  known limitation. Document saved mutation response snapshots/GetReservation.
- **Key output:** Edited migration 006's legacy update conversion/type check
  in place and changed CreditService's update history to RESERVATION_UPDATED.
  Added ValidationError extends Error for deliberate identifier/amount/version/
  page-size/bookmark/event validation. Only that class maps to INVALID_ARGUMENT
  and REST 400. Ordinary TypeError stays unexpected, producing generic Internal
  credit-service error and logging the original error on the server. Known
  business reasons, authentication, and transient-database codes are preserved.
  Bookmark decoding converts only expected malformed JSON/UTF-8 input failures;
  unexpected decoder exceptions propagate. REST now authenticates only after a
  known GET route is matched. Unknown paths and unsupported methods return 404;
  known GET routes without a token return 401. Added proto/README mutation
  snapshot wording; no wire fields or replay behavior changed. Historical prompt
  archives and prior log entries retain their original spelling.
- **Local database correction:** Migration 006 had already run locally. In one
  transaction locked public.credit_history, dropped its type check, updated
  the misspelled label to RESERVATION_UPDATED, and installed the corrected check
  from migration 006. Committed after verifying unchanged non-type row data,
  row count, and all index definitions. Zero local rows required renaming; the
  check was corrected. No sequence/identity/index statement was rerun, no data
  reset, and no follow-up migration 007 added. External shared deployments were
  not inspected; the human supplied the no-shared-application confirmation.
- **Affected locations:** credit-service/migrations/006_history_types_and_paging.sql;
  src/services/{CreditService,validation,historyBookmark}.ts;
  src/grpc/errors.ts; src/rest/server.ts; src/events/userCreated.ts;
  test/{auth,core-credit,initial-allocation,rest,history,user-created}.test.cjs;
  credit-service README, docs/user-decisions.md, this log and prompt archive 025;
  shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto and README; root README final disclosure.
- **Agent verification:** Full workspace build passed. All 74 credit tests
  passed with PostgreSQL and temporary API listeners, no failures/skips. Eight
  shared contract/transport tests passed. New regression coverage checks an
  ordinary TypeError from a real service call returns generic gRPC INTERNAL,
  no private message/reason trailer, and the exact error object is logged;
  HTTP service TypeError returns generic 500 and the original error is logged;
  intentional validation remains INVALID_ARGUMENT/400 without a DB connection;
  known mappings remain; unknown paths without tokens are 404, both known GET
  routes without tokens are 401, POST to either route is 404 with/without a
  valid token; and saved reserve snapshots replay after updates/releases while
  GetReservation returns current state, without writes. Updated fresh-schema
  migration tests accept the corrected label and reject the old typo. The local
  database correction verified row/index preservation. Code generation ran for
  the proto comment change; generated bodies were unchanged and prior generated
  files/attributions were retained. Docker rebuild/start passed. No-write runtime
  checks verified REST 404/401/POST404, typed INVALID_ARGUMENT, and preserved
  NOT_FOUND/ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND behavior. Header/log/documentation links and
  tracked diff whitespace checked. Coverage figures from entry 022 remain
  historical, not a new run for these changes.
- **Human review/sources/instructions:** Human review pending. Used the human's
  decisions and repository code/tests; no new external sources or copied
  third-party implementation. Read root AGENTS.md and existing empty service
  AGENTS.md. No skill, delegation, commit, merge or deployment performed.
- **Remaining integrations:** RabbitMQ startup/User Service publication remain
  teammate-owned; automatic client retries and archival/restoration are unchanged.

## 026 — Restore balance user IDs and return full reservations for lookups

- **Timestamp:** Began 2026-10-21 12:07 SGT (UTC+08:00); implementation and
  verification completed during this session.
- **Tool/model and modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; implementation of the human's
  explicit contract changes, regeneration boilerplate, regression verification,
  documentation and disclosure maintenance.
- **Exact prompt/key responses:** [Read-contract expansion request and key
  implementation responses](prompts/026-expanded-read-responses.md).
- **Human-defined change:** Restore string user_id = 1 in Balance and return
  userId from CreditService.getBalance. GetReservation must return the same full
  Reservation as mutations instead of the separate three-field response. No
  additional schema/interface decision was selected by AI.
- **Key output:** Restored balance field 1 and removed its user_id reservation;
  timestamp reservations and credit field numbers remain. getBalance returns the
  account's userId. GetReservation uses Reservation in the proto, generated
  service/client types and wrapper. Its controller directly forwards the full
  service result. Removed the obsolete GetReservationResponse message and
  generated source/ignored compiled output. Existing courier optional-presence
  behavior is retained. REST now forwards the service's four-field balance
  directly. The internal initialization return and event callback use
  Omit<Balance, 'userId'> at type level to preserve existing three-credit
  initialization results and persisted replay responses; no stored result was
  rewritten or initialization behavior changed. No SQL/migration change.
- **Affected locations:** shared/grpc/proto/credit.proto; src/clients.ts;
  src/generated/credit.ts, credit/{Balance,CreditService}.ts and retired
  credit/GetReservationResponse.ts; test/credit-contract.test.cjs; shared README;
  credit-service/src/services/CreditService.ts, src/grpc/server.ts,
  src/rest/server.ts, src/events/userCreated.ts;
  test/{core-credit,auth,rest}.test.cjs; credit-service README,
  docs/user-decisions.md, this log and prompt archive 026; root README final
  disclosure. Prior human-review markers remain, with entry-026 edits marked
  pending human review.
- **Agent verification:** Full workspace build passed after resolving the
  compiler's duplicate userId warning by forwarding the service balance from
  REST. All 74 credit checks passed with PostgreSQL and temporary API listeners,
  zero failures/skips; eight shared wire/transport checks passed. Existing tests
  were updated rather than adding redundant tests: real service balance reads
  assert user identity across mutation/concurrency cases; controller and shared
  wire tests assert the full reservation fields, including optional courier for
  settlement and its absence for active holds; REST still returns its four
  fields and applies JWT subject scope. Initial allocation/replay tests still
  verify the existing internal result shape. Regenerated types, restored
  attribution, and removed only the retired compiled response type. Docker
  clean compilation/rebuild/start passed. Packaged server/client runtime checks
  verify balance identity and full reservation serialization with isolated
  in-memory fixtures; no application-data writes. Current attribution/log/docs
  links, the final root README disclosure and tracked whitespace checked.
  Earlier coverage numbers are historical; coverage was not rerun here.
- **Human review/sources/instructions:** New edits await human review. Used the
  human's exact contract and repository implementation/generation conventions;
  no new external source or third-party implementation code. Read root AGENTS.md
  and existing empty service AGENTS.md. No skill, agent delegation, commit,
  merge or deployment performed.
- **Remaining integrations:** RabbitMQ startup/User Service publication remain
  teammate-owned; automatic client retries and archival/restoration are unchanged.

## 027 — Shared Credit client retry request

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-21 16:28 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Completion timestamp:** 2026-10-21 16:50 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model and modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; bounded requirements
  interpretation, implementation after human finalization, regression testing,
  documentation and disclosure maintenance.
- **Exact prompt/key responses:** [Retry request, exact human answers and
  implementation/check results](prompts/027-shared-credit-retries.md).
- **Human-defined behavior:** Cover all six Credit RPCs using an application
  loop, at most three total attempts, short growing/capped/jittered backoff,
  one deadline covering attempts and delays, no retry after the client's deadline,
  no retry when its delay consumes the remaining budget, and return the last
  error unchanged. Earlier retryable codes remain UNAVAILABLE, ABORTED and
  DEADLINE_EXCEEDED. The human then finalized a 1,300 ms budget; 50 ms initial
  delay, growth factor 2, 500 ms cap, half-base plus random-half jitter; each
  attempt uses the remaining time; defaults allow optional client and per-call
  overrides. No separate per-attempt cap was introduced.
- **Key output:** All six shared Credit wrappers use the application loop and
  one absolute deadline. Client/per-call fields are maxAttempts, initialDelayMs,
  backoffMultiplier, maxDelayMs, plus the existing timeoutMs/deadline. Overrides
  merge individually. Retryable codes only are retried. Delay >= remaining time
  skips the wait/retry; late timers cannot start an expired attempt. The original
  last error is thrown unchanged. Already expired upstream calls reject with
  DEADLINE_EXCEEDED without a transport attempt. Other service clients retain
  their behavior. Existing explicit timeoutMs, including createPeerClients
  configuration, overrides the new Credit default. No proto/schema change.
- **Affected locations:** shared/grpc/src/clients.ts and
  test/credit-retries.test.cjs; shared and credit-service READMEs; this log,
  prompt archive 027, and the root README final disclosure.
- **Agent verification:** Full workspace build, 51 shared checks (43 new retry
  checks), and all 74 credit checks against PostgreSQL/local listeners passed,
  zero failures/skips in the completed runs. Coverage includes all six methods,
  status selection, exact error identity/trailers, configuration precedence,
  jitter bounds/capping, whole-call and upstream deadlines, skipped delays,
  late timers, and real wire metadata/request/error preservation. The initial
  sandbox-only listener check failed with EPERM; authorized local-listener
  rerun passed. Diff whitespace checked. No Order retry implementation was found
  in this checkout; no teammate branches were inspected.
- **Human review/sources/instructions:** Human review pending. Read root
  AGENTS.md and the empty credit-service/AGENTS.md. Used repository sources;
  no external source, copied third-party code, new dependency, skill, delegation,
  commit, publication, or deployment. Prior PR-only drafting remains
  excluded from repository logs as explicitly requested by the human.

## 028 — Settled-reservation retry fallback

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-21 18:47–18:49 SGT (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model and modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; implementation of the human's
  finalized settlement behavior, regression tests, documentation and disclosure.
- **Exact prompt/key responses:** [Settlement fallback request and key
  implementation response](prompts/028-settlement-retry-fallback.md).
- **Human-defined change:** Without a saved result, SETTLED with the same courier
  returns the current full reservation without writes, using the release branch's
  return shape. SETTLED with a different courier fails with REQUEST_CONFLICT;
  RELEASED remains INVALID_STATE; RESERVED continues normal settlement.
- **Key output:** Added the SETTLED check before the active-state check. Same
  courier returns `{ reservation, changed: false }`; a different courier throws
  FAILED_PRECONDITION/REQUEST_CONFLICT. Saved-result replay/hash checks still run
  first. No balance/history/version/replacement retry-record writes on either
  settled fallback path. No schema, proto or shared retry-client changes.
- **Affected locations:** credit-service/src/services/CreditService.ts;
  test/core-credit.test.cjs; service README and docs/user-decisions.md;
  this log and prompt archive 028; root README final AI Use Summary.
- **Agent verification:** Observed both new PostgreSQL regressions fail before
  the fix (same courier rejected and different courier returned INVALID_STATE).
  Full workspace build then passed. All 77 credit checks and 51 shared checks
  passed with PostgreSQL/temporary local listeners, zero failures/skips. New
  cases delete the transfer retry record only inside an isolated test schema,
  compare all four table snapshots across concurrent same-courier retries, and
  verify the record stays absent. Different-courier conflicts include an
  existing account, a missing account, and the requester ID. Existing coverage
  still checks saved-result replay/conflict, RELEASED rejection and active
  settlement. Test schemas are removed afterward; no application-data changes.
  Diff whitespace checked.
- **Human review/sources/instructions:** New changes await human review; prior
  human-review markers are preserved and do not claim approval of these edits.
  Read root AGENTS.md and the empty credit-service/AGENTS.md. Used the human's
  explicit behavior and repository code; no external source, copied third-party
  implementation, dependency, skill, delegation, commit, push or deployment.

## 031 — Database constraints, public history, health and local references

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-22 00:08 SGT (UTC+08:00); request received across the
  previous day's session boundary.
- **Tool/model and modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; implementation/tests against
  supplied behavior, bounded clarification, debugging and documentation.
- **Exact prompt/key responses:** [Verbatim request, confirmed history-sign
  clarification and actual outputs](prompts/031-constraints-history-health.md).
- **Human-defined changes:** Positive reservation amount/version constraints;
  history-sign checks (exact SQL combinations confirmed, grant exactly 10); internal-only
  history sequence IDs with database-backed tests; untrack three exact internal
  reference files; public health following existing User/Order behavior.
- **Affected paths:** migrations/007_credit_delta_constraints.sql;
  test/{constraints,history,rest}.test.cjs; src/rest/server.ts and src/index.ts;
  service/shared/root README updates; .gitignore; prompt archive 003 attachment
  links; this log and archive 031; local ignored postman README, generator,
  preparation helper and regenerated collection YAML. Only the three requested
  document removals were staged by git rm --cached; their files remain locally.
  Unrelated ongoing human edits were preserved, including shared transport tests.
- **Implementation:** PostgreSQL validates amount/version > 0 on inserts and
  updates. New migration rejects invalid existing rows transactionally without
  deleting/repairing them. Applied migrations are unchanged, and local application
  database migration 007 was subsequently applied successfully. REST removes sequenceId at the public
  serialization boundary; internal repository fields and paging tokens remain.
  The DB-backed HTTP test checks public entry order and late-write exclusion.
  Postman preparation reads expected IDs ordered by sequence_id directly from PG.
  Health probes SELECT 1 without JWT and returns User/Order's 200 ok/up or
  503 degraded/down JSON. Historical path mentions/exact prompts remain in the
  AI archives; broken active links to local-only reference copies were removed.
- **Agent verification:** Workspace build passed; 84 Credit checks passed using
  isolated PostgreSQL schemas and localhost listeners, with zero failures/skips;
  all 51 shared checks passed. The initial sandboxed shared run failed eight
  listener checks with EPERM; permitted rerun passed all checks. Both Python
  helpers compile; 110 YAML files pass the retained official v3 schema;
  103 generated Postman scripts parse; all four CLI collection
  lint runs have zero errors/warnings (19/44/29/1 request definitions). Existing
  historical live Postman figures belong to entry 030, not a new live run.
  All three removed-from-index documents remain on disk and are explicitly
  ignored. Seed exclusion remains; no credentials read or new runtime seed used.
- **Limitations/review:** The human confirmed the exact history signs and an initial grant of exactly
  10. New code/docs/tests await human review.
  Full diff whitespace checking reports one concurrent human edit in shared
  transport.test.cjs; this task's scoped changes have no whitespace errors.
  Existing Order demo prerequisites remain; no live combined Order run claimed.
- **Sources/instructions:** Root AGENTS.md and existing local source/Order branch
  health implementation; CLI help and previously retained Postman schema only.
  No new external source, third-party implementation, dependency, skill, agent,
  commit, push, publishing or deployment. AI attribution remains in ai/ and the
  final README section; internal design/requirements copies are not required
  attribution artifacts.

## 035 — Human-decided plaintext-only Credit gRPC

- **Date/timezone:** 2026-10-22, Asia/Singapore (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model/mode:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; implementation/test/config/docs updates
  following the human's finalized transport decision.
- **Exact prompt/key responses:** [Plaintext-only request and outcomes](prompts/035-plaintext-grpc.md).
- **Changes:** Explicit insecure server credentials; removed TLS helper and
  local-mode/certificate/key env schema, Compose and example entries; retained
  service-token authentication and REST JWT verification/public-key path. Shared
  Credit client defaults already match; no client/retry implementation changes.
  Old TLS-gate test replaced with removed-config/obsolete-setting regressions.
  Service/shared/root READMEs and disclosure updated; earlier prompts kept intact.
- **Affected paths:** src/index.ts, src/env.ts, deleted src/grpc/tls.ts;
  test/auth.test.cjs; compose.yaml; .env.example and .env.docker.example;
  credit-service/README.md; shared/grpc/README.md; root README final summary;
  this log and archive 035. Unrelated event-consumer edits and prior work retained.
- **Checks:** 15 auth/REST tests pass with no failures/skips; scoped TypeScript
  check of index and transitive imports passes. Real source startup on temporary
  ports confirms plaintext gRPC/service-token auth, REST 401 without JWT, and
  health SELECT 1 (200 ok/up). Old invalid transport env values are ignored.
  Child and temporary public-key directory cleaned up; no data writes or running
  service replacement. Compose/example auth/transport checks, local links and
  scoped whitespace pass.
- **Full-build limitation:** npm run build fails on the current unedited
  events/broker.ts and events/userCreated.ts imports of unresolved @foc/messaging
  and resulting implicit-any errors. Ongoing teammate integration was preserved.
  Full suite and Docker rebuild not run for this change; prior 84/51 figures are
  historical. Scoped compile/tests and actual startup provide the stated checks.
- **Instructions/review/provenance:** Root AGENTS.md, empty service instructions
  and existing repository implementations; no external source or copied code,
  dependency, skill, agent, commit, push or deployment. Human owns the transport
  decision; no rationale/trade-off analysis generated. Human review pending.

## 036 — Nonfatal event consumer startup and shutdown

- **Date/timezone:** 2026-10-22, Asia/Singapore (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model/mode:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; configuration/entrypoint implementation,
  lifecycle tests and documentation following bounded human clarification.
- **Exact prompt/answers/key responses:** [Entrypoint request and confirmed choices](prompts/036-event-startup-wiring.md).
- **Human choices:** Keep APIs running if consumer startup fails. Leave messaging
  package integration pending while the human works out the details. No package,
  branch, dependency or lockfile was merged/installed/changed.
- **Implementation:** RABBITMQ_URL follows the existing shared/User convention;
  host default is localhost:5672 and Docker example explicitly uses a host-reachable
  broker URL. After API readiness, the entrypoint loads/calls the existing helper
  in a nonfatal background attempt using the same CreditService. Package loading,
  connection and registration failures are logged without closing APIs. There is
  one startup attempt, no new reconnect/retry policy. Duplicate signals clean up
  once; shutdown stops APIs, awaits pending consumer startup, closes a connected
  broker, then ends the pool. Broker close rejection is logged without skipping
  pool cleanup. Human-edited broker/handler files were preserved.
- **Affected paths:** src/index.ts, src/env.ts; .env.example/.env.docker.example;
  compose.yaml; test/startup.test.cjs; service/root README; this log/archive 036.
  Tests were prepared temporarily before the human answers, then restored into
  the repository after confirmed behavior was implemented.
- **Agent checks:** All 23 affected API/lifecycle tests passed with zero failures/
  skips (15 auth/REST plus eight entrypoint tests). Isolated child-process lifecycle
  checks mock broker/database/transports and cover success, slow/failed consumer,
  missing package, duplicate signals, shutdown during pending connection, broker
  close failure and API bind failure. Real source startup on temporary ports with
  the actual missing messaging package confirms logged consumer failure while
  plaintext gRPC authentication, REST 401 and health 200/ok/up remain available.
  Child/key directory cleaned up; only SELECT 1, no data writes or real broker
  traffic. Compose/example checks, scoped whitespace and local links passed.
- **Build/integration limitation:** Credit build was attempted and still fails
  only in the human-edited event files on unresolved @foc/messaging and consequent
  implicit-any errors. Package integration remains explicitly deferred. No full
  suite, live event delivery or Docker rebuild pass is claimed for this exchange.
- **Inspection/sources/instructions:** Root AGENTS.md and empty service instructions;
  current helpers and local remote-tracking shared/User code only. Matching local
  validation ref inspected: 0b48f5f85be01d148176a6410c9ca22c2b8e672e. No fetch, branch
  merge/copy, external source, dependency, skill or agent. Human owns the clarified
  lifecycle behavior; no rationale/trade-off analysis generated. All new changes
  await human review; no commit/push or replacement of the running Credit service.

## 037 — Import attributed messaging package and verify listener

- **Date/timezone:** 2026-10-22, Asia/Singapore (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model/modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; mechanical source import, integration
  configuration, regression/integration tests, debugging and documentation.
- **Exact prompt/key responses/PR attribution:** [Import request, source ownership
  and actual results](prompts/037-import-messaging-listener.md).
- **Human scope:** Supersedes the earlier package deferral. Copy shared/messaging
  so Credit builds/listener can be tested; attribute ownership to its implementers
  in the PR. No original broker implementation was generated or redesigned here.
- **Source/ownership:** Existing local events/data-validation commit
  0b48f5f85be01d148176a6410c9ca22c2b8e672e, @sunpterodactyl/shared messaging
  contributors. Twelve files imported; 11 source/config files match byte-for-byte,
  only README adds provenance. Original code/AI declarations preserved. Imported
  JSON manifests/config are original upstream bytes, attributed in README/log.
- **Changes/paths:** shared/messaging/**; root package.json/package-lock.json;
  credit-service/package.json/Dockerfile; test/user-created.test.cjs and
  initial-allocation.test.cjs assertions aligned with human-edited behavior;
  new test/listener.integration.cjs; service/shared messaging/root README;
  this log/archive 037. Workspace/build/predev/runtime dependency wiring added.
  Existing JSON attribution exception used for generated manifest/lock changes.
  Human's broker and userCreated helpers unchanged. No whole-branch merge or fetch.
- **Agent checks:** Full workspace build, all 94 Credit tests and all 51 shared
  tests passed with no failures/skips. Dedicated live listener test passed six
  scenarios/seven results: allocation visible via JWT REST, duplicate events,
  injected transient retry, delivery mismatch/inconsistent-account dead-lettering,
  restart idempotency. Real compiled index, RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL used; child
  verifies schema isolation before starting. Docker build and runtime messaging/
  consumer module resolution passed. Source-byte equality, scoped whitespace,
  local Markdown links and npm lock diff checked.
- **Cleanup:** Test schemas, rows, processes, temporary public key/logs and owned
  RabbitMQ container/anonymous volume removed. Existing Credit/Postgres containers
  kept. No existing queues purged or application database reset. Sandbox-blocked
  npm install was stopped by its verified PID, then permitted install succeeded
  with lifecycle scripts disabled. amqplib 2.2.0 and Zod 4.6.7 resolve from the
  unchanged upstream ranges; their lockfile metadata lists MIT. No broader
  licensing validation is claimed.
- **Review/instructions:** Root AGENTS.md and empty service instructions used.
  Human review pending for integration/tests/docs. Original broker authors retain
  ownership and responsibility for their declarations. No external web source,
  skill, delegation, commit, push, remote PR edit or running-service deployment.

## 038 — Startup-only listener health with database-based status

- **Date/timezone:** 2026-10-22, Asia/Singapore (UTC+08:00).
- **Tool/model/modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; bounded clarification followed by
  implementation, regression checks and documentation against human decisions.
- **Exact prompt/answers/key responses:** [Listener-health request and choices](prompts/038-listener-health.md).
- **Human-finalized behavior:** Add listener up/down, reporting startup success
  only. Keep health HTTP status based on database alone. Existing overall status
  follows the database; healthy DB returns 200/ok even when listener is down.
- **Implementation/paths:** src/rest/server.ts receives the startup-status reader;
  src/index.ts tracks pending/failure/success and explicit shutdown, including a
  late consumer completion after shutdown began. No connection/cancellation
  detection or shared broker changes. Updated tests rest/history/startup and live
  listener integration; service/root README, local ignored Postman generator/
  generated collections/README; this log and archive 038. All affected source/docs
  headers attribute the new scope without claiming human review.
- **Agent checks:** Full workspace build and 94 Credit tests passed, zero failures/
  skips. REST health tests cover four database/listener combinations with no JWT
  and invalid JWT; startup tests cover successful/slow/failed consumer and shutdown
  races. Real source startup against an unreachable test broker gives HTTP 200,
  status ok, db up, listener down with APIs available. Real compiled application
  with isolated RabbitMQ/PostgreSQL gives health listener up; six live scenarios/
  seven Node results passed. Postman REST lint clean; all 103 scripts parse. No
  shared suite/Docker rebuild or full native Postman run repeated for this change.
- **Cleanup:** Integration schemas/rows, child processes, temporary public key/logs
  cleaned; dedicated RabbitMQ test container and its anonymous volume removed.
  Existing services/queues/application data kept. No real broker outage forced on
  the user's services. Shared imported source/config remains unchanged.
- **Instructions/provenance/review:** Used root AGENTS.md, empty service instructions,
  existing local source and installed amqplib types during inspection. No external
  source, dependency, skill, agent, commit/push or running-service replacement.
  Human decisions finalized before implementation. New changes await human review.

## 039 — History constraints and scoped seeded ledger invariants

- **Timestamp:** Verification/documentation completed 2026-10-22 12:04 SGT
  (UTC+08:00); date/timezone Asia/Singapore.
- **Tool/model/modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; implementation/test/documentation
  against the human's complete schema/invariant/scenario definitions.
- **Exact prompt/key responses:** [Full schema/invariant/randomized request and
  outcomes](prompts/039-history-ledger-invariants.md).
- **Human-defined changes:** Non-grants require both history links; initial grants
  forbid both. Partial uniqueness on (reservation_id, type) for RESERVED,
  RELEASED, TRANSFER_OUT and TRANSFER_IN. Shared scoped SQL returns violating
  rows for actor/order/held-amount/version/status/terminal/ledger/conservation
  checks. Seeded bounded concurrency, account initialization through initCredits,
  per-round drained checks, allowed business errors, unexpected/deadlock failure,
  skip without PGDATABASE, stop/report genuine violations without weakening.
- **Code confirmation:** createReservation sets version 1; update/release/settle
  each adds 1 on actual state change; settlement writes one OUT/one IN, so version
  counts OUT only. Saved replay/no-write fallbacks do not change history/version.
  No production business implementation was changed.
- **Affected paths:** migrations/008_history_links_and_uniqueness.sql;
  test/sql/ledger-violations.sql, test/helpers/ledger-invariants.cjs;
  test/history-links.test.cjs and ledger-invariants.test.cjs;
  test/constraints.test.cjs/history.test.cjs linked-fixture updates;
  service/root READMEs; this log/archive 039. The pre-existing human edit to
  migration 001's review comment was preserved; no applied migration rewritten.
- **Scenario/oracle:** New test owns isolated schemas and explicit user/reservation
  arrays. SQL returns named violating rows/details, including missing expected
  accounts. Deterministic control covers both update directions, identical
  requests, opposing settlements, release and rejected terminal transitions.
  Query self-tests inject known bad fixtures then roll back; explicit scope
  excludes inconsistent unrelated account/reservation fixtures. Four seeds
  (12825, 587811, 1592594996, 3735928559), four accounts per random scenario,
  eight rounds of 48 requests each (1,536 random requests plus deterministic
  operations). Six workers never exceed the six-connection pool. No oracle query
  runs until all active operations drain. Seed override documented; thread winners
  can vary. Unexpected errors, including 40P01, are never accepted/retried as
  business outcomes. A failure stops remaining scenario rounds/seeds and prints
  the seed/round/request or SQL violation details.
- **Actual verification:** Six new Node test results passed first; then all 100
  Credit tests passed against local PostgreSQL/listeners with zero failures/skips.
  All seeded round queries returned empty arrays. No genuine service violation,
  deadlock or unexpected error found. Explicit no-PGDATABASE run cleanly skipped
  the two new integration tests. Migration rollback tests cover bad legacy links
  and duplicate indexed events without losing rows or leaving partial DDL;
  direct insert/update constraints and repeated allowed update events checked.
  Oracle probe failures were deliberate expected fixtures, not service violations.
- **Database/cleanup:** Migration 008 applied successfully to the local Credit
  database through the transactional CLI; existing data not repaired/deleted.
  Isolated test schemas/pools cleaned up. No existing service replacement, queue
  changes or broker tests for this SQL/test-only task. Prior build/shared-suite/
  Docker results remain historical; not unnecessarily rerun.
- **Review/provenance/instructions:** Root AGENTS.md/empty service instructions,
  supplied rules and existing repository implementation only. Local Markdown links,
  scoped whitespace, test syntax and final diff checked. No external source,
  dependency, skill, agent, commit, push or deployment. Human review remains
  pending; no assignment compliance/human validation asserted.

## 040 — Remove account and reservation timestamps

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-22 12:35 SGT (UTC+08:00), Asia/Singapore.
- **Tool/model/modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; implementation, tests and documentation
  of the human's finalized column-removal request.
- **Exact prompt/key responses:** [Timestamp-removal request and outcomes](prompts/040-remove-account-reservation-timestamps.md).
- **Human-defined change:** Remove createdAt/updatedAt (SQL created_at/updated_at)
  from accounts and reservations. No archival/deletion design was generated.
- **Implementation/affected paths:** New migrations/009_remove_account_reservation_timestamps.sql
  drops four columns; src/domains/types.ts removes CreditAccount date fields;
  src/repos/SqlCreditRepository.ts removes their SELECT/UPDATE references;
  test/initial-allocation.test.cjs removes an obsolete timestamp write;
  test/timestamp-removal.test.cjs adds an isolated-schema upgrade regression;
  service/root READMEs and this log/archive updated. Existing migration SQL was
  not rewritten; the human's pre-existing migration 001 comment edit remains.
  Reservation already had no timestamp fields in its domain/API output. History
  and idempotency timestamps are retained; public API shapes are unchanged.
- **Actual verification:** Credit TypeScript build passed. All 103 Credit Node
  results passed against local PostgreSQL/listeners, zero failures/skips. The
  new upgrade test seeds valid accounts/holds through CreditService before 009,
  checks all business data plus history/idempotency records are preserved exactly,
  verifies only the intended timestamps disappear, exercises new/existing account
  operations and saved update replay, and runs the existing scoped ledger oracle.
  All four seeded concurrency scenarios passed against the latest schema with no
  genuine invariant violation, unexpected error or deadlock. The new integration
  test also cleanly skips without PGDATABASE. Test syntax/reference/diff checks
  completed; no unrelated shared-suite, Docker or live-broker rerun.
- **Database/cleanup:** Migration 009 ran only in isolated test schemas, which
  were removed and connections closed. Running local database remains at 008;
  README documents applying 009 with the updated service build. No running service
  was replaced, application rows changed or queue altered.
- **Review/provenance/instructions:** Root AGENTS.md and empty service instructions
  read; existing implementation and supplied requirements used. No new external
  source, dependency, skill, sub-agent, commit, push or deployment. Human review
  remains pending; agent-run tests do not establish author validation.

## 042 — Simplify gRPC service-token comparison

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-22 12:49 SGT (UTC+08:00), Asia/Singapore.
- **Tool/model/modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; implementation, verification and
  documentation of the human's explicit authentication change.
- **Exact prompt/key responses:** [Authentication simplification request and outcomes](prompts/042-direct-service-token-comparison.md).
- **Human-defined change:** Remove hashing and timingSafeEqual from auth.ts.
  Implemented direct string equality for gRPC service secrets; the human made
  the security choice. No trade-off analysis or decision rationale generated.
- **Affected paths:** src/grpc/auth.ts; service/root READMEs; this log and archive
  042. Removed node:crypto import, configured-secret digests and incoming-token
  hashing; lookup now compares the supplied token directly with configured
  tokens. Existing empty/duplicate configuration checks, missing/non-string/
  unknown token rejection and identity-based authorization remain. REST JWT,
  request hashes and advisory-lock encoding were not part of this change.
- **Actual verification:** Credit TypeScript build passed; all eight existing
  auth.test.cjs tests passed, zero failures/skips. Tests cover configured secret
  identity, invalid token/configuration rejection, all six RPC authorization
  checks, successful authorized calls, reason trailers, generic internal errors,
  JWT verification and input validation. No new tests were needed. Scoped source
  and documentation/diff checks completed. Previous full 103-test result remains
  historical; no unrelated SQL/shared-suite/Docker rerun or container replacement.
- **Review/provenance:** Root AGENTS.md and empty service instructions read;
  existing implementation/tests and the supplied change used. No external
  source, dependency, skill, agent, commit or push. Human review pending.

## 043 — Entry-ID history bookmarks with internal sequence boundaries

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-22 13:36 SGT (UTC+08:00), Asia/Singapore.
- **Tool/model/modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; implementation, tests and documentation
  against the human's finalized token and boundary-lookup specification.
- **Exact prompt/key responses:** [Full bookmark request and outcomes](prompts/043-entry-id-history-bookmarks.md).
- **Human-defined change:** Base64url-encode the last returned entry's ID instead
  of user/sequence JSON. Resolve sequence through entry ID plus authenticated user;
  keep ordering/index/query internal and otherwise unchanged. Same validation
  error for malformed, missing and other-user IDs; reject old format. No schema,
  migration, page-size or response-shape change apart from token contents.
- **Affected paths:** src/services/historyBookmark.ts and CreditService.ts;
  src/repos/CreditRepository.ts and SqlCreditRepository.ts; test/rest.test.cjs
  and history.test.cjs; service/root READMEs; this log and archive 043. Bookmark
  decoder validates canonical unpadded base64url/UTF-8 and a hyphenated UUID;
  SQL lookup is parameterized `WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2`. Missing scoped
  lookup results throw ValidationError('Invalid history page token'), matching
  malformed/legacy format errors. Sequence values remain decimal strings inside
  the repository/service; REST already omits them from entries. Existing human
  edits to allocation constants and review comments were preserved; REST server
  was not edited in this exchange.
- **Actual verification:** Credit TypeScript build and all 103 Credit Node tests
  passed, zero failures/skips, using local PostgreSQL and REST/gRPC test listeners.
  Unit cases cover exact decoded UUID, malformed IDs, trailing whitespace/control
  characters, invalid UTF-8/base64url, JSON-wrapped IDs and legacy objects. SQL
  tests resolve sequences above JavaScript safe-integer range and reject missing/
  other-user lookups. Service tests retain default 50/max 100 and exact full-page
  continuation. Authenticated REST tests compare pages with database sequence
  order, inspect every outgoing token, exclude later writes and verify identical
  400 bodies for malformed/missing/other-user/legacy tokens. Existing account-lock
  late-commit and all four seeded ledger scenarios also passed with no genuine
  violation, unexpected error or deadlock. Test syntax/source/diff checked.
- **Runtime/review/provenance:** Isolated schemas and test listeners cleaned up;
  no application rows, migrations, running container or dependencies changed.
  No unrelated shared-suite/Docker/live-broker run. Root AGENTS.md and empty
  service instructions plus existing source/supplied decisions used; no external
  source, skill, agent, commit or push. Human review pending.

## 045 — Remove user and timestamp metadata from idempotency records

- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-26 12:55 SGT (UTC+08:00), Asia/Singapore.
- **Tool/model/modes:** OpenAI Codex, GPT-6; implementation, refactoring, tests and
  documentation against the human's finalized column-removal request.
- **Exact prompt/key responses:** [Idempotency refactor request and outcomes](prompts/045-remove-idempotency-metadata.md).
- **Human-defined change:** Remove user_id and created_at from the existing
  idempotency_records table and refactor its code/tests. New migration 010 drops
  only those columns. operation_type, idempotency_key, request_hash and result
  remain, including the existing composite PK/checks/NOT NULL rules. Previous
  migrations were preserved. No new schema/interface/architecture decision or
  rationale was generated.
- **Affected implementation:** migrations/010_remove_idempotency_metadata.sql;
  src/domains/types.ts removes IdempotencyRecord.userId; SqlCreditRepository.ts
  reads/writes four remaining columns; CreditService.ts stops passing userId to
  saved idempotency records. Operation keys, hashes, atomic transactions, conflict
  checks, response JSON and replay behavior remain as supplied by the human.
- **Affected tests:** initial-allocation.test.cjs and listener.integration.cjs
  count allocation records by operation_type='init_credits'/idempotency_key=userId;
  fixtures and injected retry-write triggers use the operation key. History and
  reservation scenarios advance to the new schema before invoking current code.
  schema.test.cjs tests the four-column idempotency shape and retained uniqueness/
  required values after its historical-schema assertions. timestamp-removal.test.cjs
  now upgrades populated data through 009/010, compares all remaining business
  rows/results/hashes, checks exact SQL/repository keys and replays initialization
  and reserve successes saved before migration after subsequent balance/version
  changes. Its legacy fixture intentionally supplies the old NOT NULL user
  column before migration; no current runtime/test lookup requires that column.
  Existing scoped SQL ledger oracle checks are retained.
- **Actual verification:** Credit TypeScript build passed. All 103 Credit tests
  passed against local PostgreSQL/API listeners with zero failures/skips. All
  four seeded ledger scenarios passed with no genuine violation, unexpected error
  or deadlock. The upgraded integration test cleanly skips without PGDATABASE.
  Live listener integration passed all seven Node results against a separate
  RabbitMQ test container and isolated migrated schema: initial allocation,
  duplicate events, transient retry, invalid/inconsistent-event dead letters and
  restart. Test syntax, source references, Markdown paths and diff whitespace
  checked. Unrelated shared-client suite and Docker build were not repeated.
- **Docs/disclosure:** Both READMEs describe ten migrations, the current four-column
  retry record, preserved replay behavior and current checks; attribution headers
  remain short. This log and archive 045 added. Human review is pending.
- **Runtime/cleanup:** Tests removed their schemas/child processes/connections;
  dedicated credit-idempotency-test broker and anonymous volume removed. Existing
  PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ and services retained. Metadata-only inspection confirmed
  the running public idempotency table still has both old columns: 010 has not
  been applied there and no runtime container was replaced.
- **Instructions/provenance:** Followed updated user-supplied/root AGENTS.md and
  empty service instructions. Existing source/contracts and supplied decisions
  only; no external source, dependency, skill, sub-agent, commit or push. Agent
  checks do not establish author validation or assignment compliance.

For each later entry, record the same fields and update the README and affected
file headers. Record actual human edits, acceptances, or rejections only when the
human provides them.
