## 2026-10-21 (Asia/Singapore): branch setup and local Order database

Tool: ChatGPT through Codex. Model identifier is not exposed in this session.
Modes: repository operations, configuration generation, documentation.

### Exact user prompts

> Set up order-core to have the same code as main by pulling etc and then lets start building. Ask me architecture etc questions if that is required by the guidelines

> Lets start by setting up the database. I think Postgres SQL works well, so similar database type as my teammate + ACID + concurrency control
> We will also work with docker containerisation so maybe set that up too

The author also supplied the CS3219 AI Usage Policy as a constraint in this chat.

### Key responses and output

- Preserved previous order-core commits on backup/order-core-before-main-20261021 and aligned order-core with origin/main at f2cedb3. Preserved leftover generated files in /private/tmp/foc-order-core-before-main-20261021/.
- Inspected User Service's PostgreSQL 16 Compose setup.
- Generated order-service/compose.yaml with PostgreSQL 16, local credentials, localhost port 5433, a persistent volume and a readiness check.
- Generated setup documentation and the final README disclosure section.
- Asked the author for the approved fields, types, statuses, relationships, constraints, database/migration library and concurrency strategy before implementing them.
- Explained that PostgreSQL transactions/concurrency primitives do not alone implement business-level concurrency rules.

### Locations

- order-service/compose.yaml
- order-service/README.md
- README.md
- order-service/usage-log.md

### Verification and author review

Verification: Compose configuration validation and git diff --check passed.
The new container reported healthy; SQL connected to order_service on PostgreSQL
16.15, and BEGIN / SELECT 1 / ROLLBACK completed successfully.
Application-level concurrency has not been implemented or tested. Human author review, understanding,
and validation remain pending; no human review is claimed by this log.

## 2026-10-21 (Asia/Singapore): Prisma setup

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Modes: dependency setup, transcription, documentation.

### Exact author schema input

```prisma
model Order {
  id                 String              @id @db.Uuid

```

### Exact subsequent implementation prompts

> Conditional update should work well for now since its simple and also ensures that only one courier gets the accepted order

```text
enum OrderStatus {
  UNASSIGNED
  ASSIGNED
  PICKED_UP
  DELIVERED
  CANCELLED
}
Go ahead with Prisma
```

### Key responses and output

- Installed Prisma CLI and @prisma/client 6.19.3 in existing @foc/order-grpc workspace, matching User Service.
- Preserved supplied model and enum in order-service/prisma/schema.prisma.draft.
- Requested OrderCreation, CancellationReason and CreditState definitions; no missing schema definitions were invented. No migrations or Order client generated.
- Recorded the author's conditional-update choice; no acceptance handler implemented.
- Updated order-service/grpc/package.json, package-lock.json, schema draft and README documentation. JSON files cannot contain attribution comments; package metadata and this log record their attribution.
- npm install completed and reported three high-severity dependency findings. No automatic dependency fixes were applied.

Human author review remains pending.

### Key response and implementation

Complete schema supplied by author. Transcribed definitions without adding business constraints. Added Prisma scripts and service-specific client output, generated initial migration and client, and applied to the verified empty local Order Docker database. Added migration attribution; replayed initial migration on that newly created empty database to keep its recorded checksum consistent. No order business handlers or credit execution/recovery were implemented.

Affected files: .gitignore, order-service/grpc/package.json, order-service/prisma/schema.prisma, order-service/prisma/migrations/*, Order README and root README, and this log. Earlier entries are consolidated in this service-local log. Human author review remains pending.

Verification: prisma validate passed; migration applied and Prisma client generated. prisma migrate status reports up to date. SQL inspection confirmed all three tables and restrictive foreign keys; OrderCreation and CreditOperation inserts succeeded inside a rolled-back transaction. Generated migration includes author-specified unique indexes. git diff --check passed. Application concurrency remains unimplemented and untested.

## 2026-10-21: Order setup issue

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Mode: dependency installation and convention inspection.

### Exact user prompt

```text
Lets continue working on anything else missing in this Issue
### Description
Set up the Order Service project structure and development environment, following the existing microservice conventions used by the team.

### Tasks
- [ ] Initialize the Order Service with the team's existing backend framework and dependencies.
- [ ] Set up the project folder structure, following existing service conventions.
- [ ] Configure environment variables and application settings.
- [ ] Set up the database connection configuration for PostgreSQL.
- [ ] Configure the Order Service to run within the existing Docker environment.
- [ ] Implement a basic health check endpoint.
- [ ] Document setup and startup instructions in the README.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Order Service starts successfully without errors.
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns a successful response.
- [ ] Environment variables are loaded correctly.
- [ ] Service runs successfully within the existing Docker setup.
- [ ] Setup instructions are documented.
```

### Key response and output

Inspected User Service's Express/TypeScript, dotenv/Zod, Prisma, folder structure,
PostgreSQL-backed GET /health, and combined REST/gRPC startup conventions.
Installed Express 5.2.1 and @types/express 5.0.0 matching User Service in the
existing Order workspace (package.json and root package-lock.json affected).
Requested team confirmation of Order transport/folder conventions and whether
the existing workspace should move before implementing those structural changes,
as the supplied course policy reserves component boundaries/interfaces for the team.
Installation succeeded; human author review remains pending.

## 2026-10-21: approved application scaffold implementation

Exact user reply to the structure/health confirmation question: `Yes.`

Interpretation stated before work: use Express plus gRPC, src/api and src/grpc,
root env/db, database-backed health matching User Service; preserve the existing
workspace location at order-service/grpc. No workspace relocation performed.

Key response: “I’ll use the confirmed Express + gRPC structure and database-backed
`/health` endpoint. I’ll keep the workspace at `order-service/grpc` for this issue
and proceed with startup, environment configuration, Docker integration, and verification.”

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Modes: implementation/configuration/documentation generation.
Implemented PostgreSQL connection/probe, dotenv/Zod configuration, HTTP health,
combined startup/shutdown, Prisma build scripts, Dockerfile/context filter and
Compose app service. Updated .env.example and README instructions. Affected files
are order-service/grpc/src/{index.ts,env.ts,db.ts,api/app.ts}, grpc/package.json,
grpc/.env.example, order-service/{Dockerfile,Dockerfile.dockerignore,compose.yaml,
README.md}, root README and this log. Human author review remains pending.

Verification completed: shared gRPC and Order TypeScript builds passed; Compose
configuration validation passed; Docker build/startup/migration completed and both
containers healthy. HTTP health returned exact User Service-style JSON with 200
when PostgreSQL was available and 503 when stopped; restored database and app
health afterward. Temporary dotenv file loaded configured ports and DATABASE_URL;
invalid PORT=0, GRPC_PORT=65536 and HTTPS DATABASE_URL were rejected. Compiled host
startup on PORT=3013/GRPC_PORT=50063 returned health 200 and exited cleanly on
SIGTERM. git diff --check passed. No order business logic was implemented.

## 2026-10-21: Consolidate Order AI usage records

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Mode: documentation refactoring.

Exact user prompt:

> Combine the AI log into within order-service AI log as I prefer most files commited from order service to be within order service

Key response: Consolidated all entries in order-service/usage-log.md, removed the
duplicate root ai/usage-log.md, and updated README, file attribution and package
metadata references. Retained the historical log path inside the already-applied
initial migration's comment to preserve its checksum; its records now live here.
Human author review remains pending.

## 2026-10-21: minimize and verify shared lockfile

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Modes: debugging, dependency configuration and verification.

Exact user prompt: “Could you do that please?” This authorizes the preceding
proposal to preserve Credit's declared dependencies, minimize unrelated dependency
changes, and verify a clean install and affected services before merging.

Key exchanges: Explained that npm had regenerated the shared root lockfile while
adding Order dependencies, that active Credit dependencies remained under
credit-service/grpc, and that other branches remain unchanged until integration.
Confirmed original main lockfile is malformed: amqplib's engines/package objects
were missing their closing braces. Fetched origin/main; it remains f2cedb3.

Generated candidate in an isolated /private/tmp checkout from main's lockfile
with that syntax repair, using npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts.
Adopted the candidate only after a clean npm ci passed. Every original package
entry and version is preserved, including Credit entries. Non-Order workspace
dependency ranges remain unchanged. Root lockfile diff reduced from 1767 added /
989 removed lines to 1388 added / 35 removed lines. Remaining edits include Order's
new dependency records, syntax repair and npm workspace/metadata normalization.
No Credit/Supplier manifests or source files were changed.

Verification:
- Clean root npm ci passed in isolated checkout.
- Installed User's own npm lock and Supplier's frozen Yarn lock in that checkout;
  generated User Prisma client and temporary keys only there.
- All five root workspace builds passed: shared grpc, Order, Credit, Supplier grpc,
  and shared messaging.
- Credit gRPC smoke check passed on ephemeral loopback port with expected
  UNIMPLEMENTED response from the existing scaffold.
- Root npm test remains blocked: shared/grpc/test/transport.test.cjs imports
  supplier-service/grpc/dist/grpc/server.js, but unchanged Supplier config emits
  grpc/dist/grpc/src/grpc/server.js. The test and Supplier configuration are
  unchanged. No all-tests-passing claim is made.
- Docker image rebuilt with minimized lockfile; Compose startup completed healthy, and HTTP /health returned 200 with {"status":"ok","db":"up"}.

Author review remains pending. Changes affect package-lock.json and this log;
originally staged content is preserved in the index until the author stages
these newer working-tree changes.

## 2026-10-22: Create/edit/cancel/expiry lifecycle implementation

Tool: ChatGPT through Codex; exact model identifier not exposed. Modes: implementation,
debugging, tests and documentation. Human author review remains pending.

### Prompts and key exchanges

- [Author lifecycle decisions](ai-prompts/lifecycle-decisions.md) archives user prompts,
  the final first-lock-wins approval, edit-operation schema and latest idempotency rule.
- [Pasted creation API contract](ai-prompts/creation-api-contract.md) archives the attached
  text used for the route/body/response implementation.
- Assistant checked this branch and corrected the assumption that a settlement/refund
  worker already existed: only persistence fields were present.
- Assistant asked for the durable edit representation and concurrent duplicate rule.
  Author supplied OrderEditOperation and explicitly removed five-minute content detection.
- Key implementation update: “I’ll follow your latest duplicate rule: the same key resumes
  the original creation, and a different key starts a separate request even if the body
  matches. I’ll also add the approved OrderEditOperation table so credit-changing edits
  retain their proposed changes and expected Credit version across restarts.”

### Locations and scope

Order grpc package/scripts, JWT authentication, API DTOs/controllers/routes/app,
User/Supplier adapters, local agreed Credit protobuf and client, creation/edit/lifecycle
services, worker startup/configuration, unit/gRPC/HTTP/PostgreSQL tests, Prisma schema
and new edit-operation migration, .env.example, opt-in compose.lifecycle.yaml,
Order README, root README disclosure, shared root package-lock.json, and these records.
The existing applied migration was not changed. Root package-lock additions preserve
all prior package versions; no teammate manifests, source or shared wire contracts changed.

Credit protobuf copied from origin/feat/credit-implementation; original attribution
comments retained. The source commit is recorded below. Generated code was reviewed
by the assistant, compiled and exercised in tests; no human review is claimed.

### Implemented behavior

POST /orders, PATCH /orders/:id, POST /orders/:id/cancel; USER JWT/ownership enforcement;
nonblank text, positive whole int32 credits, offset-bearing expiry at least one hour
at initial validation, current supplier-open checks; stable-key creation replay/conflict;
credit reservation reconciliation before publication; durable credit edits using
UpdateReservation/expectedVersion; history-preserving cancellation; expiry through pickup;
automatic durable recovery and compensation, initial attempt plus five bounded retries.
Unresolved states stay recorded for reconciliation and are not reported as paid/refunded.

### Verification and limits

Final checks: TypeScript/Prisma build passed; 8 unit/authentication/gRPC tests and
23 dedicated PostgreSQL/HTTP/gRPC lifecycle tests passed (31 total). Docker image
built, both containers healthy, /health returned 200, and Prisma reported both
migrations applied. Opt-in Compose configuration validated. All existing root
lockfile package keys and versions were preserved; git diff --check passed.
The disposable lifecycle test container was removed after verification; the normal
Order stack remains running. Test doubles exist only in tests.
Supplier GetSupplier and the checkout's old Credit RPC handlers remain stubs; the
suite does not certify a full deployed peer-service flow. Acceptance/pickup/delivery,
listing/history UI and operator reconciliation endpoints are not implemented here.

Credit contract source commit: 15bb4cde30de15822d2f4be3a06c85fc5f36edb5

## 2026-10-22: administrator all-orders endpoint

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Modes: implementation, tests and documentation.

Exact user prompts:

> Could you set up an endpoint with authorisation for administrators for the admin dashboard to view all orders? (Includes expired and completed orders too but can be filtered out if admin chooses in the view)

> GET /orders

> I think just supply information for now. I will work with the admin dashboard person to see if they will do the rest from their end

Key response: “I’ll add administrator-only GET /orders, returning all orders in
{ "orders": [...] } with the existing public order fields. I’ll leave filtering
and pagination to the dashboard for now.”

Implemented an ADMINISTRATOR role guard and GET route before the USER-only write
guard; added a read service with explicit public-field selection, controller JSON
mapping, and newest-first deterministic ordering. Includes every persisted status,
including DELIVERED and CANCELLED/EXPIRY. No pending internal creation records or
recovery payloads are returned. No schema or dependency changes.

Affected files: grpc/src/auth/authenticate.ts, grpc/src/api/routes/orderRoutes.ts,
grpc/src/api/controllers/orderController.ts, grpc/src/services/orderQueries.ts,
grpc/tests/lifecycle.integration.cjs, Order README, root README disclosure and this log.
Human author review remains pending. Verification: TypeScript/Prisma build passed;
all 24 dedicated PostgreSQL/HTTP/gRPC integration tests passed, including the new
administrator endpoint test. Verified ADMINISTRATOR and mixed-role access, USER
denial, missing-token denial, all persisted statuses, internal-field exclusion,
and unchanged USER-only write authorization. Docker rebuilt and both containers
are healthy; git diff --check passed. Disposable admin test container removed.

## 2026-10-22: ignore Prisma artifacts left after branch switch

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Mode: configuration fix/explanation.
Exact user prompt: “Do these need to be commited too or is something up”
The screenshot showed untracked order-service/src/generated/prisma output.
Confirmed current branch is order-functionality and its ignore rule covered only
grpc/src/generated/prisma. Added the other branch's generated output directory
to root .gitignore; no generated files were deleted or staged. Schema sources
and migrations remain tracked. Human review pending.

## 2026-10-22: previous-issue audit and cancellation/expiry verification

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Modes: review/debugging, implementation, tests and documentation.
Human author review remains pending.

### Exact user prompt

```text
Has the previous issues been completed? Do a check and if yes, lets work on this next
### Description
Implement cancellation and expiry functionality for errands according to the agreed Order Service lifecycle.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement the Cancel Errand API endpoint.
- [ ] Allow requesters to cancel their own unassigned errands.
- [ ] Prevent unauthorised cancellation.
- [ ] Handle errands that have passed their expiry time.
- [ ] Update the order status according to the agreed cancellation and expiry rules.
- [ ] Integrate with Credit Service to release reserved credits for cancelled or expired errands.
- [ ] Handle unsuccessful credit-release operations.
- [ ] Add tests for cancellation and expiry scenarios.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Requesters can cancel eligible errands.
- [ ] Assigned errands cannot be manually cancelled by requesters under the current requirements.
- [ ] Expired errands are handled according to the agreed lifecycle.
- [ ] Reserved credits are released correctly.
- [ ] Invalid or unauthorised cancellation requests are rejected.
- [ ] Tests cover successful and unsuccessful operations.
```

### Key findings and changes

Confirmed current branch is order-functionality, with prior creation/edit/admin
and cancellation/expiry code present. Preserved earlier .gitignore/log edits.
The previously author-approved plaintext Credit change existed only on
feature/order-create; removed the remaining CA setting, createSsl choice and CA
file read from this branch too. Preserved readFileSync for User's public key;
service-token authentication unchanged. Updated .env.example and README.

Cancellation already commits CANCELLED/REQUESTER and REFUND_PENDING before the
Credit call. Fixed the immediate path to retain that durable pending response
when refund processing/receipt persistence fails, instead of returning HTTP 500.
Added tests for cancellation authorization/input/state errors, concurrent replay,
pre-commit release failure, explicit rejection, historical/wrong-owner receipts,
refund retry exhaustion, failed receipt persistence/crashed lease, and autonomous
expiry. Extended the real gRPC adapter integration test through cancellation and
confirmed release. No schema, dependency, or new API design changes.

Affected files: grpc/src/services/orderLifecycle.ts, grpc/src/dependencies/creditClient.ts,
grpc/src/env.ts, grpc/src/index.ts, grpc/.env.example, grpc/tests/credit.test.cjs,
grpc/tests/lifecycle.integration.cjs, Order README, root README and this log.

Verification: shared gRPC/Order builds passed; all 9 unit/authentication/gRPC tests
and 32 dedicated PostgreSQL/HTTP/gRPC integration tests passed (41 total).
Creation/edit/admin regression cases passed. Tests use an isolated database named
order_service_test_cancellation and test-only peer services. No deployed peer-service
end-to-end success is claimed. Remaining courier acceptance/pickup/delivery and
student-list/detail gaps identified earlier are outside this issue.

Docker rebuild/startup passed; both normal containers healthy and /health returned
200 with PostgreSQL up. Disposable cancellation test container removed after
verification. No database schema or lockfile changes; git diff --check passed.

## 2026-10-22: manual integration walkthrough

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Mode: documentation generation from inspected code/contracts.
Exact user prompt: “Write me up some manual testing steps like how to use with user, supplier and credit to create an order etc”

Inspected User registration/login, Supplier routes/stub/conflict markers, Credit
feature-branch Compose/environment/migration instructions and REST endpoints, and
Order runtime override. Generated MANUAL_TESTING.md with readiness checks, separate
working peer checkout setup, non-conflicting database ports, registration/login,
credit-account prerequisites, supplier checks, creation, replay, edit, cancellation,
admin view, recovery and expiry. Explicitly states current checkout cannot complete
live creation without implemented peer services/user.created initialization.
No live service setup or account/order mutation was performed for this documentation.
Added README link; human author review pending.

Documentation validation: all 20 shell command blocks passed bash -n syntax
checks; git diff --check passed. Commands were not executed against live peers.

## 2026-10-22: courier acceptance

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Modes: implementation, unit/concurrency/HTTP testing, documentation.
Human author review remains pending.

### Exact user prompt

```text
Lets work on this issue now
### Description
Implement errand acceptance according to the agreed Order Service lifecycle, ensuring that an unassigned errand can only be accepted by one eligible courier.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement the Accept Errand API endpoint.
- [ ] Verify that the user is authenticated and eligible to accept the errand.
- [ ] Prevent requesters from accepting their own errands.
- [ ] Verify that the errand is currently `Unassigned`.
- [ ] Ensure concurrent acceptance attempts cannot assign multiple couriers.
- [ ] Persist the assigned courier and update the order status to `Assigned`.
- [ ] Handle unsuccessful acceptance attempts.
- [ ] Add unit and concurrency tests.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Eligible couriers can accept available errands.
- [ ] Requesters cannot accept their own errands.
- [ ] Already assigned errands cannot be accepted again.
- [ ] Only one courier can successfully accept an errand, including during concurrent requests.
- [ ] Successful acceptance persists the correct courier and status.
```

### Key response and output

Found the checkout on supplier-containerisation with only leftover ignored
Prisma artifacts. Switched the otherwise clean checkout back to order-functionality;
Supplier source was unchanged. Used the author's previously confirmed first-lock-wins
rule and existing /orders/:id/action convention. Implemented POST /orders/:id/accept
with USER JWT identity, self-acceptance rejection, current state/credit/expiry and
active-edit checks under the Order row lock. Persists courier ID, ASSIGNED and
acceptedAt in one transaction. No additional Credit call; courierName remains null.
Existing creation/edit/refund/expiry behavior retained.

Affected files: grpc/src/services/orderAcceptance.ts, grpc/src/api/app.ts,
grpc/src/api/controllers/orderController.ts, grpc/src/api/routes/orderRoutes.ts,
grpc/tests/acceptance.test.cjs, grpc/tests/lifecycle.integration.cjs,
Order README, MANUAL_TESTING.md, root README and this log.
No schema, dependency, shared contract or teammate-source changes.

Verification: shared gRPC/Order builds passed; all 13 unit/authentication/gRPC tests
and 38 dedicated PostgreSQL/HTTP/gRPC tests passed (51 total). Twelve simultaneous
couriers produced one successful command and one persisted courier. Tested
cancellation races, pending edits, expiry after lock wait, replay rejection,
role/ownership/UUID/body failures and JWT-derived assignment without Credit
configuration. Manual guide updated; live peer setup was not executed.

Docker build/startup passed and both normal containers report healthy. Removed
only the disposable acceptance test database. Manual shell snippets passed bash -n;
git diff --check passed. Changes remain uncommitted on order-functionality.


## 2026-10-22 — Relationship-based retrieval

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Modes: generate implementation, tests and documentation.
Human review remains pending.

Exact implementation request: "Lets complete this issue."

Exact user contract reply:
```text
for available errands: GET /orders?scope=open
for errands the user created GET /orders?scope=requested
errands assigned to user: GET /orders?scope=assigned

all return 200 OK with structure including order id, status, destination and credits
```

Key response/implementation: retained the public `{ "orders": [...] }` format,
newest-first ordering and unpaginated response. Scoped listings require USER and
use verified JWT subject. Open excludes own, non-UNASSIGNED and overdue orders.
Requested/assigned retain history; this history behavior was stated as an
implementation assumption rather than an explicit answer in the contract reply.
Unscoped GET remains ADMINISTRATOR-only. Invalid/empty/repeated scopes and unknown
query parameters return 400. Empty results return 200 with an empty array.
No schema or inter-service contract changes.

Affected files: grpc/src/services/orderQueries.ts,
grpc/src/api/controllers/orderController.ts, grpc/src/api/routes/orderRoutes.ts,
grpc/tests/lifecycle.integration.cjs, README.md, MANUAL_TESTING.md, this usage log,
and root README.md. Author review and final validation pending.

Verification: shared/Order builds passed; 13 unit/auth/gRPC tests and 39 real
PostgreSQL/HTTP integration tests passed (52 total). Retrieval coverage includes
open ownership/status/expiry filters, requester/courier history, empty results,
JWT identity, role separation and invalid/injected query fields. Used a dedicated
order_service_test_retrieval database; normal development data was not changed.

Lets work on this now
### Description
Implement the agreed gRPC communication between Order Service and Credit Service to support credit operations throughout the errand lifecycle.

### Tasks
- [ ] Configure the gRPC client using the team's agreed Credit Service interface.
- [ ] Integrate credit verification and reservation during errand creation.
- [ ] Integrate credit transfer upon successful errand completion.
- [ ] Integrate credit release when eligible errands are cancelled or expire.
- [ ] Handle Credit Service errors and unavailable-service scenarios.
- [ ] Verify that unsuccessful credit operations do not incorrectly complete the corresponding order workflow.
- [ ] Add integration tests for credit operations.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Order Service communicates successfully with Credit Service.
- [ ] Credits are reserved during successful errand creation.
- [ ] Reserved credits are transferred upon successful completion.
- [ ] Reserved credits are released for eligible cancelled or expired errands.
- [ ] Integration failures are handled without silently reporting incorrect results.
- [ ] Integration tests cover successful and failed operations.
```

Key response: the plaintext/token client and creation/release integration exist;
SettleCredits is exposed by the adapter but not called by an order completion
workflow. Asked the human for the completion route, caller, allowed source state
and pending-settlement lifecycle; these decisions remain pending.

Added test-only real gRPC transport wrapping the simulated ledger in
`grpc/tests/lifecycle.integration.cjs` alongside real Order PostgreSQL. Tests
exercise reservation, same-key replay, cancellation/expiry release, business
rejection, uncertain reservation, release recovery and token rejection. These
are contract/transport tests, not deployed Credit Service certification.
Compared local proto with local feat/credit-implementation: identical except
Order attribution comments. Restoring locked npm dependencies was necessary
because the Prisma executable was missing. Verification results follow below.


Exact user completion decision:
```text
POST /orders/:id/deliver
Only the assigned courier can mark it
PICKED_UP before delivery
DELIVERED for now
```

Key implementation response: delivery is recorded as DELIVERED with
SETTLEMENT_PENDING and returns 202 until matching current Credit settlement is
confirmed, then 200. Added a durable SETTLE operation using the existing schema,
lease and bounded retry policy; the existing worker now recovers settlements.
Only the assigned USER courier can deliver an unexpired PICKED_UP order with a
reserved hold. Replays do not transfer twice. Explicit business failures and
retry exhaustion preserve unresolved financial state. Stale or mismatching
receipts never mark settlement confirmed. No pickup endpoint was introduced.

Additional affected files: grpc/src/services/orderLifecycle.ts,
grpc/src/api/controllers/orderController.ts, grpc/src/api/routes/orderRoutes.ts,
README.md, MANUAL_TESTING.md and root README.md. Existing source attribution
headers apply to these AI-assisted implementation changes; human review pending.

Verification: locked npm ci completed; shared/Order build passed. 13 unit tests
and 48 PostgreSQL integration tests pass (61 total). Initial test expectations
were corrected: an invalid service credential after durable recording returns
202 rather than 503, with no published order. Tests exercise real plaintext gRPC
with test-only ledger handlers; no live deployed Credit end-to-end claim.
Settlement coverage includes before/after-commit failure, background recovery,
concurrent delivery, same-courier replay, role/ownership/state/expiry validation,
wrong/stale receipts, permanent failure/exhaustion and database receipt-write
failure followed by expired-lease recovery. No dependency lockfile changes.

Docker rebuild/startup succeeded with the existing alternate host ports
(PostgreSQL 55441, HTTP 33003, gRPC 55053); both containers healthy and /health
returned 200 with {"status":"ok","db":"up"}. Removed the disposable Credit test
container and volume. Documentation shell snippets and git diff --check passed.
Changes remain uncommitted on order-functionality.

## [Order Service] Implement Order Editing with Credit Service Integration

### Description
Implement order editing functionality to allow requesters to modify their errands before they are accepted by a courier.

Order Service must communicate with Credit Service via gRPC when an edit changes the number of credits offered. Credit reservations must be adjusted safely, ensuring consistency between the order details and reserved credits.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement `PATCH /orders/:id` to allow requesters to edit their orders.
- [ ] Restrict editing to the original requester while the order is `UNASSIGNED`.
- [ ] Validate updated order details, including supplier, destination, request details, credits, and expiry time.
- [ ] Integrate Credit Service's `UpdateReservation` gRPC method to adjust reserved credits when the credit amount changes.
- [ ] Verify sufficient available credits before approving an increase in the offered credits.
- [ ] Release excess reserved credits when the offered credit amount decreases.
- [ ] Ensure credit adjustments are atomic and idempotent to prevent duplicate deductions or releases.
- [ ] Prevent conflicting acceptance and editing operations using database concurrency control.
- [ ] Persist pending credit-edit operations to support recovery after failures or crashes.
- [ ] Handle Credit Service errors, timeouts, and unavailable-service scenarios.
- [ ] Implement retry and reconciliation mechanisms for uncertain credit adjustment outcomes.
- [ ] Add integration tests for successful edits, insufficient credits, concurrent requests, and Credit Service failures.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Requesters can edit their own `UNASSIGNED` orders through `PATCH /orders/:id`.
- [ ] Orders that have already been accepted, delivered, or cancelled cannot be edited.
- [ ] Edits that do not change credits do not trigger unnecessary credit adjustments.
- [ ] Increasing credits successfully adjusts the existing reservation when sufficient credits are available.
- [ ] Decreasing credits releases the excess reserved amount.
- [ ] Failed credit adjustments do not incorrectly update the order's credit amount.
- [ ] Concurrent editing and acceptance requests cannot produce inconsistent order or credit states.
- [ ] Pending or uncertain credit operations can be safely recovered without duplicate adjustments.
- [ ] Successful edits return the updated order using `{ "order": {...} }`.
- [ ] Integration tests cover successful, failed, and concurrent editing scenarios.

### Dependencies
- Credit Service must support the agreed `UpdateReservation` gRPC contract.
- Credit Service must provide atomic, idempotent reservation updates and sufficient information for reconciliation.
- Order Service must support durable tracking and recovery of pending credit-edit operations.
```

Key response: existing production editing already provides the required endpoint,
validation, row locking, durable intent and version reconciliation. Added missing
real gRPC transport coverage rather than rewriting the working implementation.
The test ledger now simulates insufficient available funds and pre-commit update
unavailability; Credit remains responsible for atomic balance enforcement.

Affected files: grpc/tests/lifecycle.integration.cjs, README.md,
MANUAL_TESTING.md, this usage log and root README.md. No production code, schema,
contracts or dependency changes. Author review remains pending.

Verification: all 55 PostgreSQL integration tests passed, including added tests
for increases consuming all available funds, insufficient credits, decreases,
unchanged credits without mutation, same-key parallel requests, first-lock-wins
acceptance races, unavailable preflight, terminal states, short expiry, invalid
supplier, before/after-commit recovery and receipt-write crash recovery. Tests
use production gRPC client plus test-only Credit handlers and a dedicated Order
database; no deployed Credit end-to-end certification is claimed.

Final verification: all 13 unit/auth/gRPC tests also passed (68 total).
Documentation shell syntax and git diff --check passed. Removed the disposable
edit test database container/volume; normal Docker service/data unchanged.
Changes remain uncommitted on order-functionality.


## 2026-10-22 21:42 +08 — d3-demo Credit/Order merge resolution

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Modes: merge debugging, configuration and documentation.
Exact user prompt: "Resolve merge conflict"

Key response: two unmerged paths, README.md and package-lock.json. Existing
partial lockfile edits were invalid JSON. Preserved that file at
/tmp/d3-demo-package-lock-before-resolution.json, seeded the valid Order-side
lock and regenerated against actual merged manifests. npm initially retained
stale moved-workspace metadata; refreshed local workspace entries from their
manifests and removed obsolete ghost paths before regeneration. No dependency
manifest versions or service interfaces were changed. Credit remains at the
human-approved credit-service root; Order stays at order-service/grpc.

Combined both services' disclosure text under a single final AI Use Summary
section. Updated Order Docker COPY from credit-service/grpc/package.json to
credit-service/package.json, preserving the incoming relocation. Updated the
Credit README JSON attribution table using the human-approved exception.

Affected paths: README.md, package-lock.json, order-service/Dockerfile,
credit-service/README.md, credit-service/ai/usage-log.md and this Order log.
Human review pending. Incoming staged service changes were preserved; no
commit, push, User/Supplier implementation changes or UI merge was performed.

Checks: clean npm ci passed; shared gRPC, shared messaging, Order and Credit
builds passed. Order tests: 13 passed. Shared gRPC tests: 51 passed. Credit
tests: 36 passed, 10 database-dependent checks skipped because no test database
was selected. These checks do not certify a full live multi-service demo.

Docker verification: Order's build stage succeeded using the regenerated lock
and relocated Credit manifest; no running service was replaced. Workspace
metadata/link checks passed. Resolution paths pass whitespace checks; the full
incoming staged diff has pre-existing whitespace in Credit prompt archives and
shared messaging/source files, which were preserved rather than rewriting
verbatim prompts or unrelated teammate source. Conflicts are staged as resolved;
merge commit remains for the human to create.


## 2026-10-22 21:55 +08 — Postman backend demo support

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Modes: bounded test suggestions, setup/test documentation
and verification of existing implementation; no architecture or schema changes.
Human review pending.

Exact user prompt:
```text
Could you support me on giving a back-end demo on postman? Like how do I set everything up (you can read the readmes) and what sorta tests i should do with the credit service
```

Key response: read the merged Credit/User/Supplier/Order READMEs, event contracts,
Docker configs and handlers. Credit is now implemented; current Supplier
GetSupplier/Compose, User event publishing and missing pickup remain actual
full-stack blockers. Wrote POSTMAN_DEMO.md with startup and migrations 001–009,
fresh local Postman identities/tokens, direct RPC hold/update/release/transfer
checks, replay and failure expectations, and the later Order integration flow.
The optional manual event publisher is explicitly a demo fixture using the
agreed user.created payload/shared publisher, not a claim of automatic User
registration integration. No fake endpoint, direct SQL funding or shortened
expiry rule was added. Existing service interfaces/architecture are unchanged.

Affected paths: order-service/POSTMAN_DEMO.md, order-service/README.md,
credit-service/README.md, root README.md, order-service/usage-log.md and
credit-service/ai/usage-log.md. No collection JSON was created; copyable
requests and existing Postman REST assertion scripts are in Markdown.

Verification: all 103 Credit tests passed against a dedicated disposable
PostgreSQL 17 database. All 7 live event-listener tests passed against that
database and a separate disposable RabbitMQ broker, including duplicate grants,
retries, dead letters and restart. No existing user/demo data or queues changed.
Postman application UI and complete live User/Supplier/Order path were not run.

Final checks: guide shell snippets passed bash -n and git diff --check passed.
Removed only foc-postman-credit-check-db and foc-postman-credit-check-broker
with their disposable volumes. Existing service containers/data were not
changed. Documentation remains uncommitted on d3-demo.


## 2026-10-22 22:21 +08 — Adopt team's shared Credit gRPC client

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex). Modes: implementation/refactoring/debugging/tests/docs.
Human review pending.

Exact user instruction:
```text
shared gRPC Credit client. Do not use own adaptor, use the one by supplier in feat/credit-implementation
```

Key response: replaced Order's custom dynamic gRPC transport with direct
createCreditClient import/instantiation from @foc/grpc in Order startup. Removed
Order's custom creditClient.ts and local credit.proto copy. Shared library/client
source is unchanged. Each lifecycle service now receives shared RpcOptions
containing the Order service-token metadata, used for all six calls including
edit preflight and recovery. Retained the prior response validation and error
classification as pure functions in creditValidation.ts, with no client/channel
or request wrapper. Existing timeout is passed via shared config; shared
transport owns deadlines and transient retries. No service/schema/interfaces
were invented and no User publisher branch was merged.

Updated existing transport tests to use the shared CreditService contract and
factory directly. Tests of durable failures intentionally set supported shared
RpcOptions.maxAttempts=1, exposing backend persistent recovery; separate default
retry tests confirm transparent transient recovery with the original token/body.
Added checks for unchanged service-token metadata across retries, preserved
error trailers, and unchanged permanent-rejection handling.

Affected: order-service/grpc/src/index.ts, services/orderCreation.ts,
services/orderEdits.ts, services/orderLifecycle.ts, dependencies/creditClient.ts
(deleted), dependencies/creditValidation.ts (added), grpc/proto/credit.proto
(deleted), grpc/tests/credit.test.cjs, grpc/tests/lifecycle.integration.cjs,
Order/Credit/root READMEs, POSTMAN_DEMO.md and both service usage logs.
Existing uncommitted Postman documentation from the preceding task is retained.

Verification: shared/Order builds passed; 15 Order unit/auth/client tests,
56 real PostgreSQL lifecycle tests and 51 shared gRPC tests all passed. Used
a dedicated order_service_test_shared_credit database; normal service data
unchanged. Runtime shared client/contract code was not edited. Tests include
reserve/update/release/settlement and transient/auth/business failure handling.

Final checks: git diff --check passed. Removed only the disposable shared-client
test database container/volume and stale ignored compiled files for the deleted
private client. No normal runtime/container/data changes. All changes remain
uncommitted on d3-demo. User event publisher remains separate and missing.


## 2026-10-22 Asia/Singapore — Approved demo integrations (in progress)

Tool: ChatGPT (Codex), merge debugging, implementation, tests and documentation.
Human review pending. Exact human decisions:
```text
Yes, retry missing accounts within the existing budget
Merge both into d3-demo
Just show what is available and put a "-" if LocationDescription is removed for now
```

Context: human approved bounded retry for NOT_FOUND/ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND only,
merging origin/main plus origin/order-supplier-gRPC, and missing Supplier
locationDescription fallback "-". Other NOT_FOUND handling stays unchanged.

Step 1: merged main's User transactional outbox, Supplier container/handler and
updated shared broker recovery. Resolved shared gRPC docs/transport smoke test,
shared messaging declaration and root lockfile conflicts. Retained Credit root
workspace relocation and working shared client; removed the obsolete Supplier
gRPC workspace reference because the approved Supplier branch removed that
manifest and uses its existing standalone Yarn package. Root build commands
follow the incoming package layout. Updated Order/Credit/User/Supplier gRPC
Docker manifest copies to match the merged workspaces. No schema/interface
design choices or decision rationales were generated.

Checks before completing the main merge: npm ci succeeded; shared gRPC, shared
messaging, Order, Credit, User and Supplier REST/gRPC compilation succeeded.
Supplier frozen Yarn install succeeded with no dependency range changes.
The second approved merge and runtime behavior fixes follow after this merge.

Affected integration paths so far: package.json/package-lock.json, shared gRPC
README/test, shared messaging index, Order/Credit/User/Supplier gRPC Dockerfiles,
root/Credit README and both service usage logs. Other incoming User/Supplier
implementation files retain teammate history; no new authorship claim.


Completed approved demo integration, 2026-10-22 Asia/Singapore:
- Merged origin/main (c7778fe), then resolved origin/order-supplier-gRPC.
- Kept approved string destination/pickupLocation schema; incoming coordinate
  payload changes were incompatible with that schema. Supplier adapter retains
  available building/floor/coordinates and substitutes "-" for missing description.
- ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND trailers on NOT_FOUND now use existing bounded recovery;
  reservation-not-found/plain NOT_FOUND remain permanent. Tested late courier
  account availability and exhaustion after initial attempt plus five retries.
- Corrected Supplier REST Docker build context and shared workspace manifest
  copies in REST/gRPC images. Updated POSTMAN_DEMO.md for User outbox, Supplier
  startup and optional manual replay diagnostics.
Validation: clean npm ci --ignore-scripts passed; Order units 16/16, shared gRPC
51/51, User tests 8/8, Order PostgreSQL integration tests 58/58 passed. The latter
include real gRPC transport, missing location creation/edit, recovery and retry
exhaustion. First sandboxed unit run could not bind sockets; rerun with socket
access passed. An added test initially omitted its edit idempotency key; fixed
and the complete 58-test suite reran successfully. Supplier Compose validation
passed. Docker build result recorded below. Test database was a separate
throwaway container on 55449; existing demo databases were not changed.
Human review pending. Full deployed User-to-RabbitMQ-to-Credit registration and
full multi-service Postman demo have not been exercised in this turn.

Supplier REST and gRPC Docker image builds both succeeded. Incoming two-file
trailing whitespace was cleaned without changing teammate behavior.


## 2026-10-22 Asia/Singapore — Supplier teammate Order Docker build fix
Tool: ChatGPT (Codex); mode: debug/configuration implementation. Human review pending.
Exact prompt:
```text
Could you try handle this for my teammate in supplier service please!
what i changed btw

1. moved zod schema for supplier gRPC validation to our shared grpc folder
2. order service imports the shared contract 
3. orderCreation initially had locationDescription for supplier with location parameter. I've changed that to my specific location parameters . see destination.

export const createOrderSchema = z.object({
  supplierId,
  destination: nonblank,
  destination: grpcsupplierSchema.pick({ buildingName: true, floor: true, latitude: true, longitude: true }),
  requestDetails: nonblank,
  credits: z.number().int().positive().max(2147483647),
  expiryTime: z.iso.datetime({ offset: true }).transform((value) => new Date(value)),
currently, im struggling to build the order service with the new supplier service since the yaml copies supplier/grpc/package.json by default and im not sure how to fix it
```
Key response: On d3-demo Dockerfile/workspaces already use the merged package
layout, but Order's Dockerfile.dockerignore retained obsolete Supplier/Credit
paths and excluded the current User/Credit manifests. Corrected its allowlist,
including shared/messaging parent traversal. Shared Supplier schema imports
already exist. Kept the previously approved destination string and missing
locationDescription "-" fallback; a destination object needs a matching
human-approved persistence/API change. Duplicate destination keys in the pasted
object are invalid TypeScript. No schema changes generated.
Affected files: Order Dockerfile.dockerignore, this log, root README.
Validation: git diff --check passed. Actual Docker build result recorded below.

Docker verification: docker build -f order-service/Dockerfile -t
foc-order-demo-build-check . succeeded, including npm ci, shared gRPC build,
Prisma generation and Order TypeScript compilation. Existing containers were
not restarted. Changes remain uncommitted for human review.


## 2026-10-23 Asia/Singapore — Native Postman live demonstration files
Tool: ChatGPT (Codex), mode: implementation/test-script/documentation generation.
Human review pending. Exact prompt:
```text
Could you make me a suitable set of postman files for the live demonstration then please!!!!!!
```
Key response: generated order-service/postman/generate.py, numbered native YAML
HTTP requests and blank environment with file-header attribution, plus README.
Uses implemented endpoints only: User register/login, Supplier listing, Credit
balance, Order creation/edit/accept/cancel/scoped listings and optional admin
listing. No pickup/details endpoint invented. No database seeding/reset or real
credentials included. Fresh accounts, stable retry bodies/keys and credit
assertions support the approved workflow. Manual supplier choice and async
initialization/pending response instructions included.
Checks: generator parses all generated scripts with node --check; artifact
shape and counts checked separately. No live service calls, Postman execution,
schema certification, or passed cross-service assertions are claimed.

Artifact verification completed: 33 unique requests and one blank-token
environment parsed successfully; 35 JavaScript scripts passed syntax checks;
git diff --check passed. No services were contacted.
